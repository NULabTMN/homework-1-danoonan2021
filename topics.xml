          Then, when
          we can understand In this life regarding
          the future.' we can understand something
          of the next Ufa. In that Intense love we
          sometimes say that we will meet again,
          . even after death. You know that is a
          amying that comes out of intense lore.
          There can be no other higher reason than
          Viet, than faith. That .is the basis of
          uigner science, higher mathematics, ''al
          though we took in the beginning some
          thing for granted, yet afterward we find
          that by that granting, by that simple
          faith, we have not lost. So with faith of
          religious, of spiritual things.
          "In the theory of Vedanta there is no
          death; and when we say that there is no
          death we should say, if we are logicians,
          that there Is no life. Life and death are
          relative. Where there Is death, there Is
          understood life. So Vedantists say there
          is no death nor life. But they say you
          have eternal life— not Ufe as relative to
          death; not life under limitations, under
          conditions, but absolute life, eternal life,
          and that life cannot have death. Noth
          ing can burn roat life, nothing can bury
          that life, nothing can finish. puKan end
          to. 'that Ufe. That Ufe is eternal and
          infinite.
          We say. for Instance, that a person con
          sists of body, senses and the mind. Wa
          do not speak of the ego and the ioul—
          they are high terms. We say, practically
          and materially, body and mind and
          ¦enaes. Now, death comes over the body.
          Death is material. Mind and senses be
          ing abstract something, spiritual some
          thing—In its literal sense being Just like a
          npirlt-^cannot end. as body ends, in death;
          cannot have death— mind and senses. They
          are abstract something. Abstract things
          cannot die; only material things die. And
          mind and senses being abstract, they*
          transmigrate from the body to another.
          All the senses and the mind. Mind Is the
          ruler of the senses; and when they de
          part, they go with some treasure. That
          means some impression that we have ob
          tained In this life. Boma philosophers will
          explain that mind and senses are nothing
          but a collection of those Impressions sim
          ply; and those impressions transmigrate
          and they go into another new body that
          will act out its temperament. Its impres
          sions. But all theories are simply general
          or individual, in some respects. To me
          some laws may be applicable; to others,
          some other laws. So, If I do some great
          things, some very high things. I may not
          coma back to earth as a human penon.
          but go to a higher plane, higher world,
          such as heaven; or some planet, higher
          planet than earth; or I may come to be
          born again as a man; or I may go to a
          lower animal kingdom. If we give rise to
          some satvie qualities in ourselves— satvio
          qualities, meaning; righteous, virtuous
          things— and if In that period wa die, we
          will go to a higher plane. And if we die
          while in our rahaa quality— rahas meaning
          activity, active quality— then we may
          come back again as men; and if we die
          In tha state of tamas. or when the dark
          qualities, the sinful things predominate,
          then we go to lower animals.
          There are many, several kinds of deaths
          and from these kinds of death we may
          gat glimpses to what kingdom, to what
          region, tha departed soul may go. If
          some persons die in bed, they have a good
          chance; but dying at night, they have not
          B o good a chance. And then some persons
          who die during the northern solstice
          then they go to the higher plane; and dur
          ing the southern, to the lower, etc. It
          has some reference to the time, also.
          Owing to some Karma we may die In the
          night, or unfavorable time; but owing' to
          other Karma, which is higher, I may
          supersede that law.
          Tha idea of the absolute God In Ve
          dantlsm is expressed in three little words
          — Sat. Chit and Ananda. Bat means abso
          lute existence; Chit means absolute Intel
          ligence, and Ananda means absolute bliss.
          Bo the absolute God means the absolute
          existence of one blissful/ intelligence.
          Everything on tha face of tha earth is es
          sentially nothing but an absolute exist
          ence. Apparently we see a variety of
          things; essentially there is no variety, but
          only unity in everything.
          Vedantlsm teaches that as a matter of
          fact we are divine, and not mortal. Mat
          ter may be mortal In a limited sense, but
          spirit can never be so. It Is always unlim
          ited—that Is to say. infinite— and absolute.
          If we try to know the real essence and
          the meaning of our existence by our splr.
          ltual culture we can understand that we
          are all eternal and ona. Our bodies may
          parish, but our souls can never perish.
          When such forms as body and the other
          external things of this world cease to
          exist as such, the eternal essence meets
          us with tha all-pervading and ever-exist
          ing substance. Vedantlsm says that
          into a germ, from, which again all tha
          phases of evolution will corns. It U by
          nature that we have become- involved,
          and it Is by the sania nature that we wUl
          go back to the causa. Now. gotag bao3i
          to tha cause is not a bad thins*. Do not
          think that li retrogression. That maaaa
          going to Brahman, going to, and becom
          ing mixed up with tha absolute. F"rom thm
          absolute we have coma and to the abso
          lute we will go. When we come from the
          absolute we say we are evolved by tha
          laws of nature; and when wa say we go
          back to the absolute the higher sTi^nfWa
          may say we are going to be Involved
          again Into the same primary causa.

          cannot see that we- are gods, that we ara
          divine powers; but w* should not d«ny
          that, wa should not neglect that. When
          some philosophers and sage*) gay so, w»
          may take that theory for granted, and w
          may continue some practice as they pre
          scribe. And if we go through that prao

          understand If I call It evolution and la
          volution; evolution, meaning expression,
          and involution meaning destruction. Na
          ture' by th» ona phasa of charaatar ax
          presses everything on tha fac* of tha
          earth or in this universe. Owlnx to tha
          existence of the laws of natur* w* hat*
          come up from the lowest animal to tha
          human nature. We have grown 09 by
          means of tha law of nature, wnloa la
          called the law of evolution. First, t&amp;a
          scientists will tell you, tha Ufa germ la ia
          the form of a mineral, than a ragatabla,
          then animal, then afterward. In tha form
          of a man. It finds its highest expression
          In man. Tha Ufa germ becomes very wall
          expressed in man. You do not find in a
          beast the kind affection, tha human Qual
          ities. Why don't you find them la a
          beast? Because tha germ Is not yet ax
          pressed very well. It will afterward be
          very well expressed when that Ufa gsrav
          will coma to bo in tha form of a man, In
          every man. even, it Is not very well ex
          pressed. A man can be a beast in human
          form. You will not find tha human qual
          ification very weU expressed in that beast
          ly man. When will It be expressed?
          When that man becomes a little more
          moral. You will find the very Uf» gana
          which you previously found in a mineral,
          in a vegetable, in a beast, moro fully ex
          pressed in an ethical, moral Ufe germ.
          In that moral man. even, you will not find
          It fully expressed yet. When that moral
          man will become spiritual, you will find
          a little more expressed tha very Ufa germ
          which you have previously found in tha
          lowest form of beast. Now. in tha spir
          itual man, even, it Is not found in Its
          perfection. When that spiritual man rises
          high above everything, every relative
          idea; when that spiritual man become*
          a god; when humanity Is transformed
          into divinity Itself, then you will find that
          germ in perfection. This is tha law of
          nature, the law of evolution. This Is ona
          phase of character in natur*.
          There is another phase of character t*
          be observed in nature. That is involu
          tion, going backward; mm a seed grows t«
          a tree and again that tree becomes In
          volved in the seed that Is produced by
          that same tree. That seed is called thai
          involution .of tha future tree, a tutor*
          tree being involved tn that seed. Nov,
          when a man becomes divlna. become*
          God, that same principle will again cocoa
          after a good many cycles, to be formad
          where there are more things tnan ons.
          then there is misery. The highest aim of
          man and of every being is happiness. And
          the real -happiness lies In the, realization
          of one universal thins. In this way Ve
          dantism teaches that every man, from
          any position, can rise to godhead.
          As a last word: Vedanta Is a system
          that embraces, that Includes, all kinds of
          thought, of sect, of religion, of philoso
          phy, of anything and everything; all
          kinds, whether they be materialistic or
          spiritual. So the Vedantlsts say only, b«
          simply a little thoughtful. Think over
          things, think over affairs; think ovsr
          things that you see, that you d*
          and that will lead you to your goal, ta
          your salvation, by way of natural pro
          cess. Be sincere and thoughtful. Do not
          be deluded, do not bo Irrational. W* can
          not see our eternal life before ns; w«
          The next higher theory is the theory of
          thought, transmitting thought. When w«
          think, suppose we think of % somethina
          very intensely that may happen, and
          afterward we ilnd that does .happen^
          and we come to understand that It Is nog
          Ing— nothing because.it was the produo*
          tion of the body. When the tree dies : it
          dies In every way, nothing remaining; and
          bo when the body dies there is no life
          afterward. . ¦¦ • ; • •.',.¦
          3uie tiling in this sense. If we take
          heaveti as a relative thing, then we may
          *neaJ£ &lt; f fjoh a place as hell. But if
                   l.^v^n is Fpcken of as eternal (as some
          Ch'i.llnn^ sneak of lt&gt;, then we cannot
          give ris-e to such an expression as etrrnal
          lieil. Whatever Is eternal is infinite.
          Whatever is infinite cannot be but one.
          And where there is no more than one.
          there cannot exist relative things. If
          there is the father, there must be the rel
          ative- tiling— the son; where there is birth,
          there must be the relative thing— death.
          In this cense, where there is heaven
          thete must be hell. But if heaven is
          LternaJ and infinite, there cannot be an
          other thir-g at the game time and the
          sa.n:c place that is eternal and infinite.
          And fn this tense we cannot have hell.
          This :s ore ct the early Ideas we get from
          the Vtdas.
          The Vedas are divided into several po&gt;
          t'ons. The last and best portion is called
          Vcdanta. I^ater on, a high philosophy or
          iginated from the Vedanta, which is njw
          known by the name of Vedantitm. In
          Vcdantism everything Is a manifestation
          i;i tome shape or other of this absolute
          God. God Is a universal and all-pervad-
          Ins essence. Eve i&gt; thing In this wor'd is
          j^t like a tcnipcrnry wave on the great
          ocean vt that universal. all-p£rvading
          lead sooner or later to this tame place.
          As a matter of fact, from a historical
          point of view, ail religions that ;are
          j»reached by r«»al prophets have emanated
          from the sam» grand and essential reli
          gion of the Vedas. If God be in every
          thing, then man cannot be born a* sin
          ner. In Vedantitm man is very near.. God
          and in one singl*- life, by spiritual cul
          ture, lie can realize practically that he
          is nothing but a part of this universal In
          telligence. And when -the individual soui
          passes off from the body it mixts with
          the one universal Intelligence. ~\ ,
          There are several theories by which we
          can understand that after death we Con
          tinue to exist. | . •
          The agnostics say that we have simple
          physical connection with this world and
          when our body, our physical organism,
          ends all connection ends. Therefore, ac
          cording to the agnostics, thsr^is no such
          thins as a future life. - We should eat,
          drink and be merry.
          From that theory we get the next hlgh
          tr theory, th«i theory of the skeptics, or
          rather, say the atheists. They say that
          from body, from a certain accumulation
          of certain things in a peculiar way, is
          produced our consdoueness, and we get
          our life. That is material production, and
          when our body dies there remains hoth-

          If you take nature as a personal some
          thing, time Is the garment of nature,' the
          dress, the robe of nature. Nature puts
          on her body the garment of time. Then
          her body is space, spread over all thte
          universe. All this universe Is ttte-body of
          nature and on that body Is the garment
          of time. Now the life of nature is -caus
          ation. The law of causation is 'the lite
          and bcuI of nature! It is by these 'three
          factors, time, space and the law -of caus
          ation, that the universe is held ia order.
          If we get rid of this Idea of time, this
          idea of space, this Idea of ¦ the Jaw of
          causation, then we are freed altogether.
          If we devote all our life and soul to tht.
          matter, though we may not be successful
          in one life, time Is' eternal before us.
          The Vedantists know that everything
          is In the course of their evolution. Con
          sequently, according to Vedantlsm, there
          cannot be one particular religion as an

          philosophy of the Vedas and to im

          thoughts of his preceptor. Sri Ramkri^h

          Jiiimkrishna. the great sage, who Is the
          m&amp;Fter of the renowned Swami Yiveka
          nso'a, and under him for over two years
          he learned spiritual practices. Then he
          became a Sannj-asln (a monk), and there
          after for many years performed asceti
          cism?, afterward going forth on travels
          to distant lands, in the course of which
          he has come to San FrancJsco and is now
          delivering lectures promulgating the
          mystic lore of the Orient. These lectures
          *re being given under the auspices of the
          Vedania Society of San Francisco, which
          tv as organized three or four years ago by
          Fw2irl Vlvekanada. A similar society
          hes been In existence in New Tork for
          some seven years.
          The Vedantlsts believe In one absolute
          God; they believe In heaven and hell only
          in their relative sense, and not' as • ever
          lasting: they think men are not born sin
          ner*, but through spiritual culture may
          make themselves as tioly and happy as
          God himself; they believe in reincarnation
          and transmigration; they hold that all re
          ligions are but paths leading to one : place,
          and they frown on such psychic powers
          as mesmerism as hindrances to the
          growth of the individual soul. ; '-
          It is the opinion of Swaml Trigunatita

          BAKERSFIELD. Nov. 25— W. A. West,
          a Southern Pacific fireman, "has made an
          affidavit in reference to Mrs. Katherlne
          Tingley, of whom he was formerly a dis
          ciple. He'says that while in Sacramento
          some years ago he heard her lecture, and
          when she turned to him and said, "There
          is . something In store for you," he was
          much Impressed and- asked what it was.
          She replied: "I cannot tell you, 'but it is
          something good." . ; .
          West then went- to Point Loma and be
          came one of her followers, contributing
          from his earnings to the support of the
          society, until be became convinced that
          he was gaining nothing and withdrew.
          Since that time, he declares, he has been,
          possessed by a . "master mind," directed
          by Mrs. Tingley, which, has sapped !hts
          strength of mind and body so as to in
          terfere with his work and' prevent his pro
          motion to an engineer's position. He has
          written to Mrs. . Tingley several times,
          begging her to relieve nim of the in
          fluence of the "master mind.V and she,re
          plied that he must suffer patiently for a
          while, as It was all for his own good.
          These letters were written by Pierce, Mrs
          Tingley's .secretary. West asserts, that,
          in some mysterious way unknown to him.
          Pierce has regained posseslon of the let
          ters. .
          West says that the discipks at Point
          Loma are put through a course of train
          ing in the occult sciences, ¦ called "Raja
          Yoga," which renders ' them completely
          subject to Mrs. Tingley's will. The chil
          dren are subject to this same course, the
          professed' object of which is to kill the
          "animal nature." ; . -v-.
          In his affidavit West speaks of Mrs.
          Tingley in bitter terms.- and says If he
          had $100,000 he would "gladly give it all
          to be freefl from her - influence."-.
          The affidavit. was made. at the request
          of the Humane Society and was forward
          ed to-night to New York, for use in the
          investigation there. '
          PROMISES BIG SENSATION.

          Tingley's School.
          NEW YORK, Nov. 25. -Commissioner of

          it," eaid Commodore Gerry to-day, "but
          If his impressions arc favorable I think
          he will be very apt to change his mind
          regarding Mrs. Tingley when he hears the
          testimony the society will submit at the
          Vext hearing.
          "In my opinion Mrs. Tingley is not a
          proper person to have the care of any
          child. She is perfectly frank to say that
          hers is the 'religion of nature'— she be
          lieves and teaches that 'whatever Is nat
          ural is right' But the point Is that chil
          oren at the Raja Yoga School receive no
          religious training. Nine of the eleven
          children whom the court of special in
          quiry has ordered back to Cuoa are Cath
          olics; two are Protestants. If they should
          arrive in Mrs. Tlngiey's school all will be
          denuded of their parental religion which
          fcs guaranteed to them by the constitution
          of the United States." ' .
          The struggle :over the eleven children
          grows more bitter.- Mrs. Tlngiey's fol
          lowers, some of whom are rich and in
          fluential, declare that Commissioner Gen
          eral Sargrnfs report will completely vin
          dicate their leader's character and firmly
          establish the Raja Yoga School. '

          The Attacks which have been made on Mrs.
          Katrerine Tlngley by various individuals and so
          cieties have brought to public attention another
          peculiar cult her form of Theosophy, by some
          called Tingleyism.
          Pact followers and believers in the Theosophic
          teachings ft Mrs Tingley have told on examina
          tion some startling thine*, have talked about their
          former priestess ac the I'irp'-: Mother." have
          born* witness of a dog named Spots, in which
          was said to be reincarnated the spirit of a dead
          Theosophic leader, and have lifted the veil on
          other practice*! which seem incredible.
          On the Other hand, the present disciples of Mr*.
          Tlngley. together with many prominent citizens
          who have become interested in her teachings, have
          rallied to h r support, and declare she is carrying
          on a great educational work. They say in her de
          fence that she tiaji raised money for a school
          where children from all the different countries of
          the world may lie taught all that Is best in history
          and philosophy. Her pupils are also trained, they
          »&lt;•&gt;. in many practical line« of work, such as draw-
          Ing. Wood carving, stenography and telegraphy,
          which might fit them for useful lives.
          The controversy has now been carried up to Sec
          retary Shaw of the Treasury Department at Wash
          ington, and he is making a careful investigation of
          the teaching* of Mrs. Tingley ajid her methods.
          I'pon Secretary Shaw's decision, moreover, hangs
          the fata of eleven &lt;*üban children who have been
          detained at Ellis Island, bound for Mrs. Tingleys
          institution, called »&gt;&gt;• her the staja Yoga School,
          and which ie situated at Point Loma, near San
          Diego. Cal. Appeal was made to Secretary Shaw
          after the special board of inquiry at Kills Island
          had unanimously decided to rend the children back
          to Cuba.
          The detention of these eleven children was first
          Instigated by the Society for the Prevention &lt;-,?
          &lt;"ruelty to Children, of this city. They were in
          charge of Dr. Van Pelt, the woman superintendent
          of the San Diego school, and arrived here the lat
          ter part of last month. The society, however, had
          la its possession the testimony of many individuals
          who were formerly connected with Mrs. Tingleys
          ecneet and her Theoeophic crusades, and began its
          attack as soon as the children reached port.
          According to Veraon M Davis, president of the
          Society for the Prevention ot Cruelty to Children.
          the people who are supplying Mrs. Tlngley with
          TrttTT to carry out her Ideas will soon find out
          last they are dupes, and then, withdrawing their
          aid. will leave the poor children as public charges.
          la the. oourse of the hearing before the comanls
          eiea Mr. Da-vis brought out statements to the effect
          that- Mrs. Tingley had not only established a
          ► choc!, bet a sort of paradise on *arth. where the
          children were taught to rerard her as a superior
          b'Jnr.
          Aecordlsg to these statements, Mrs. Tlngley has
          •t San Dlejrw a "Lotus Farm." where the one
          hundred and flfty rhtldr«*n inhabitants are termed
          "lyotos buds." Theme children have been brought
          fir the most part from Cuba. The buildings of the
          fare*. wMHi were *nld to be of handsome archl
          eaetisM end expensive workmanship, have been
          SWtM eniefly hy private buttons
          Th&lt;&gt; whole society, of which Mrs. Tlngley is the
          h»t!j. Is termed the Universal Brotherhood. With
          in the brotherhood, however, there is an Inner
          circle* called the Esotene Society of Tbsneopnj
          Only those who were considered fit by Mr*. Ting
          ley .-.re admitted to these mysteries of mysteries.
          Thus, her former bookkeeper told how he had been
          admitted to the Esoteric Society of Theosophy.
          while his wife was det.arred. Every MM joining
          this Inner circle must give, up all secular ties.
          Purple, according to this bookkeeper, was the
          color of highest honor, and only Mrs. Ting- ley wore
          purple. Thus she was colled by some the "Purple
          Mother." Her gown was described as a Grecian
          affair, loose and flowing. White ranked next, and
          that of lovest rank was red. All of the Universal
          Hrothcrhood are accustomed .&lt;&gt; go to "the Holy
          Hill" to greet the sunrise. The Esoteric Society
          of Tneosophy had still other rites, In which Mrs.
          Tlnglt-y was the central and most mysterious fig
          ure. These ceremonies are performed in what is
          called the Temple of Isls.
          According to some witnesses brought forward by
          Mr. Davis, husbands and wives are often separated
          by Mr.=. Tlngley. and their children taken from
          them to be cared for at the Raja Yoga school.
          Thus Henry J. Bonn, of Chicago, says that he
          was compelled to get his children back by habeas
          corpus proceedings, and found them when they
          were apparently sttiplfied by drugs. Dr. Mary K.
          Green, the grandmother of the chlllren, tells, fur
          thermore, that the children of the "Lotus Farm"
          sleep together in tents Thus twenty boys and
          girls* sleep in a single tent, she says, where their
          hands are tied together around their necks by a
          fourteen-year-old girl, who goes around at night
          from tent to tent. Mrs. Green added:
          "My grandchildren were at the school six weeks.
          My (laughter. Mrs. Bonn, was either crazed or
          hypnotized by Mrs. Tlngley when she took them
          there. Katherine Tlng'.ey Is regarded a high
          priestess, and all her followers bow down and
          worship her. The farm is fenced in. All gates
          are guarded. Great secrecy prevails. Mrs. Ting
          ley lives in sumptuous style from the subscrip
          tions she receives. My grandchildren were half
          starved when they were rescued, while my daugh
          ter, who is their mother, had not bathed them or
          eaten with them or ever put them to bed. Instead,
          she used to march past them once a day, bare
          foot and in a white robe, to greet the sunrise."
          More grotesque than anything else which has
          been said about the Point Loma scnool Is the story
          of the favorite dog of Mrs. Tingley. It Is a King
          Li T l** spaniel, and In cold weather wears a
          blanket. Ills name is Spots, because, as one of the
          former followers of the creed rather colloquially

          Spot*. Accordingly, the dog Is said to be regarded
          a* an object of reverence at Point Loma. and Mrs
          Tine-ley v once reported to have said of the spaniel:

          and a higher type of manhood and womanhood."
          •The education." she adds. "is laid out on the
          broadest lines possible, and Mrs. Tlngley is satis
          fled with nothing less than the best. The forcing
          system does not exist, for the whole aim is to draw
          out the child'! powers and possibilities. In his
          tory, for instance, he Is taught to study the law
          of cause and effect, the reason for the rise mid
          fall of nations, and la not compelled to memorise
          a mass of lifeless facts. Besides this, the children
          are taught music, dramatic art. drawing, painting,
          modelling, woodcarving, stenography, telegraphy,
          according to their aptitudes. They also learn
          botany, astronomy, geology and the other sciences.
          The character Is also developed The child must
          become self-reliant, earnest and capable of assum
          ing responsibility."
          As to the dog Spot* she says:
          "1 would feel thai 1 was Insulting the Intelli
          gence of the ordinary reader in taking the trouble
          to deny the grotesque statements about a little
          doif made by some of our maligners, were it not
          that some regarded as intelligent have apparently
          made these statements seriously. There is, to be
          sure, a little dog at the Point named Spots— a great
          pet with everybody, ami it is just possible that
          Nome may have been heard to say in fun (for yen
          very earnest people may relax Into baby talk)
          that Spots is very wise, and knows a good The-
          OSOpbiSl at sight, or that he knows all that is
          being talked about, or that he is better than many
          people. But l should be sorry for any one who
          could not discriminate between fun and serious
          ness. Spots can do that, but the further state
          ments which have been made about him are the
          results of imaginations which are. to say the least,
          unnecessary, and as I said before, to the person
          of average Intelligence it is unnecessary to deny
          th*&gt;m.
          "Mr*. Tlngley holds that the beat moral and In
          tellectual results cannot be obtained without a
          sound physical basis, so It is considered a duty to
          guard and Improve the children's health. I should
          like to contradict the statement that they are ever
          allowed to go out Improperly clothed But it must
          be remembered that the climate of Southern Cali
          fornia is very mild, and that it rarely rains there
          The wonderful climate helps in this, but its effect
          Is supplemented by careful attention to diet, by ap
          propriate physical exercises and other means. Two
          physicians at least are always on call. in case of
          need '• .
          Mrs. Tlngley was first married In 1867 to R. H
          Cook. Some years later he was about to sue for
          a divorce, when he was told she was dead Both

          Ml S S L S
          r~T\ HAT there is a great deal of good in the old
          ' ' Hindu philosophy of rest and relaxation is a
          truth that has again been demonstrated by
          two circumstances of recent happening. One
          _ _ of these is the fact that many young girls,
          girls as young as 10 or 12 years of age, find it
          necessary to retire from active school work or mental
          and physical exertion of any kind, temporarily, and
          take a rest cure, just as the jaded society woman
          withdraws from her social activities to recuperate,
          and during the retirement they are taught the value
          of absolute relaxation. The other is that, simul
          taneously with the scientific study of rest and relaxa
          tion by the young girl of today, the Yogi treatment
          and philosophy are brought into prominence by th«
          leaders in the Emmanuel movement, who rely upon
          this o!d Hindu method for restoring the mind and
          body to a natural and healthful condition. Yogi
          breathing, Yogi physical exercises and Yogi philoso
          phy of relaxation are made a feature of the practical
          side of the Emmanuel treatment of certain cases, and
          this form of treatment is proved to be so beneficial in
          restoring wasted mental and physical force that the
          method is now being applied to young persons, the
          idea being that the sooner a girl learns how to rest
          and relax scientifically the stronger will be her vital
          ity and the better will be her ability to withstand the
          strain that modern life puts upon the individual.
          r? is not because girls are breaking down earlier or
          are showing a loss of nervous force at a younger
          age than formerly that they are being taught how
          to take care of themselves after the oriental fashion,
          bet because parents and guardians see that it is
          essential for them to learn as early as" possible the
          value of this quaint and simple philosophy which
          has been practiced centuries upon centuries and has
          brought about excellent results. The difficulty ex
          perienced by a grown person in learning to relax
          properly and to rest perfectly is multiplied by that
          person's years. It follows quite naturally, then, that
          the earlier one begins studying this science the easier
          it comes to one and the greater are its advantages
          all during life.
          Besides the beneficial effects derived from the
          practice of Hindu philosophy and physical exercises
          the idea of the science can not fail to appeal to the
          yotmc girL The principle of the treatment is simple
          to enderstaud and the rule* art easy to follow, while
          the results are nearly always immediate enough to
          be encouraging aad to stimulate interest in the cult
          , One of the hardest things to do is to relax com-
          pletely. Soz.e persons think they are letting go of
          their muscles, but in reality they s.re not. Instead**
          the majority of their muscles are tense and it is
          almost impossible to get them to relax even after a
          series of mental and physical treatments. Relaxing
          li partly mental, so that youthful minds are easier
          AMONG the beet relaxing exercises are those
          which start with the body standing and letting
          go ct each nmscle and joint separately. First
          the arrcf^are outstretched in front and the fingers
          are permitted to drop, to fall of themselves, and when
          they are perfectly limp and inactive then the relaxing
          should be continued to the forearm, then to the upper
          arm, letting the whole arm drop loosely at the side
          and not only remain motionless but possess the sen
          sation of utter relaxation. These exercises in letting
          go of the tension of the muscles. should be continued
          to the feet, then the legs, the pupil lifting and drop
          ping each one in turn; then to the shoulders and the
          head by letting the latter fall loosely as it will either
          in front or to one side and the whole upper part of
          the body "slumping" forward. Even the waist and
          the hips can be relaxed, although the loosening of the
          tension will be less noticeable. Now, after the various
          muscles have been taught what perfect relaxation
          means— and this is only the beginning of the treat
          ment — lie down on a couch or a bed that is not tto
          soft and let go of the entire body, supplementing the
          physical relaxation with r mental attention to these
          muscles and members of the body. The Hindu main
          taint that the mind must be fixed on the muscle
          relaxation in order to get the best results and to mak^
          the "letting go" thorough and complete, especially
          when one is learning the first principles of relaxing.
          Resting like this once or twice during the day will,
          restore one quickly to normal condition, and a few
          minutes devoted to perfect relaxation are worth an
          hour or more of sleep of the ordinary kind. It sounds
          more or less absu/d to one who does not understand
          the art apd science of relaxation and perfect rest to
          say that one's energy and vitality can be restored
          without having the pupil lie down. The method
          to pursue in this quick restoration process is to stand
          erect in a rather active position — that is, with the
          head up, shoulders back and chest expanded, slightly.
          The arms should be allowed to drop loosely at the
          tides. While thus poised raise the body on the balls
          of the feet, lifting the heels gradually and throwing

          First Position «f the Yogi Minute Resting
          the weight forward, with the body still held erect and
          not tilted forward. As the heels rise the arms should
          be lifted straight out at the sides and upward until
          they pass above the horizontal line. Breathe deeply
          as the arms ascend, then hold the position for a
          minute or so and gradually let the heels drop down
          and the arms fall limply at the sides, not forgetting
          to exhale slo\yly and evenly as the original position is
          resumed. :\ / / t
          PROPER breathing has quite as much to do with
          the success of the relaxing and the muscle exer
          cises as the movements themselves. One can

          breathing in the oriental fashion and continuing the
          action for a few minutes. While lying flat on your

          finger or the thumb close one side tightly, making it
          necessary to breathe through the other. Rhythmical

          breathing is essential to&lt; perfect repose. With the
          , hand at the nostrils alternate by inhaling through
          the right side and exhaling through the left; then re

          Instead. of expanding the chest first as you. breathe
          try abdominal breathing for the rest cure by continu
          ing the. reclining position and alternating the nostrils
          as inhalers' and exhalefs. Then begin by taking a
          deep breath from deep, down in the abdominal region,
          gradually inflating the other parts of the 5 chest and
          lungs as the breathing is. continued on up to the very
          tops of. the lungs. In this way the. abdomen, chest
          and even the upper section of the lungs or the collar
          bone arc raised and expanded with the air. Hold

          according to this well tried and excellent method.
          The physical reasons for proper breathing, which
          includes the development of the body, improvement
          of the condition of the blood and the greatest resftt
          ance to disease, are subjects discussed in the physi
          ology class and will be taken up later on,' if the girl
          lo whom these ideas are suggested is still too young
          to have gone deeply into this science. But if her
          parents and teachers start heron the right track she
          ''will have much to be grateful to them for in after
          : &lt;
                THERE are some excellent and quite simple physi
                cal exercises recommended by the followers of
                the Hindu philosophy, which help .to \ keep one
          ttrbng an*d happy. They can. be practiced any time,
          preferably in the morning before the bath, and need
          not be continued for more than a few minutes. If
          they are repeated again before going to bed all the
          better, for a few such exercises taken regularly and
          earnestly are much more effective when divided this
          way" than done all in a single half hour or an hour..
          There is less of a strain on the mind and muscle and
          they become a tonic. Many young girls grow enthu
          siastic over simple exercises at first, then they lose
          interest, and if they do continue the physical move
          ments their minds wander to o^Jier matters. The
          result 'is that the exercises, taken in this way, .are
          lardly better than none at all. It is most important
          that the mind and the body work together, and that
          Jhe mind help the muscles to make the movements
          jtistas it helps ' them to relax. -.
          Nearly all of these simple exercises are taken Xn a
          To Relax Begin with the Fingers and Let
          Go of Every Muscle of t^c *
          Body Separately.
          standing position, with the feet spread a little apart,
          heels almost touching, head up, shoulders back, chest
          expanded and the abdomen drawn in. This is the way
          to start. Then, if you want to begin with an easy
          exercise stretch the arms forward in front, keeping
          them level with the shoulders, and with the palms
          of the hands pressed together gently, not rigidly,
          swing the arms back, keeping them on the same hori
          zontal plane until they are as far back of the shoulders
          as they will go. At first you will not be able to touch
          the backs of the hands, but after a little practice this
          will come quite readily. Do this quickly backward
          and forward for 10 times and then see how much
          better the muscles of the back feel and how much
          casisr it is to stand erect.
          * VARIATION of th:* exercise, one intended to
          l\ develop the che^t and* improve the lung power,
          •*• \u25a0*\u25a0 is to stand in the same position, raise the arms
          to a level with the shoulders, bending them at the
          elbow so that the hands come over the chest and the
          elbows stand out aggressively. The next movement
          is to swing the elbows backward as far as possible,
          pulling the chest and bringing the shoulder blades
          together, still keeping the arms even with the shoul
          ders. In fact, the test of the correctness of this
          • exercise -is when the shoulder blades touch, all the
          way down, or practically so.
          The bending exercise should be included among tho
          morning ones. Stand in the original position, then
          lift the arms straight up over the head, touching the
          thumbs. When the arms and body are perpendicular
          drop the arms suddenly, bending forward at the hips,
          but do not bend the knees, and see if you can touch
          the floor with the tips of the fingers*. This will come
          easily after a few times, and eventually you may bt
          able to lay the palms of the hands on the floor whil«
          keeping the knees stiff. S

        AMAZING FLANK MOVEMENT
        “ A
        American Women Subscribe to
        Them Because Eternal
        Youth Is Offered,
        The remarkable Invasion being
        made by the Hindu priests Into the
        homes of American women Is dis
        cussed in an interesting article en-
        Utled, "The Heathen Invasion,” b>
        Mabel hotter Daggett, in the October
        Hampton-Columbian Magaalne.
        The writer declares that American
        women are losing their fortunes and
        their reason in seeking the eternal
        youth promised by the swarthy
        priests of the Far East.
        “While the churches of America
        are spending &lt;&gt;6,008,000 annually,"
        says the writer, In the case of foreign
        missions, the pagans have executed an
        amazing flank movement; they have
        sent tholr emissaries to us. Today
        the tinkling temple bells ring out with
        a derisive, jarring note in a Christian
        land.
        "Seattle has its Buddist temple;
        San Francisco has its Hindu temple;
        Los Angeles has its Krishna temple.
        “The Vedanta society of New York
        has laid at West Cornwall. Conn., the
        corner stone of a greater temple than
        these. It is marked, as are stones
        trees set apart for worship in In
        dia, with red paint, the sacred vermil
        ion. And graved deep in New Eng
        land granite is set the most holy word
        of the Vedantlsta—’Om.'

        to represent their scot In the west.
        "The yoga class is becoming as pop
        ular as the Browning class or the
        Shakespeare class. It is the direct
        means by which a Swami reaches the I
        public. Through Its aid, tho eastern
        teaching is gathering a wider clientele I
        thin it formerly numbered among the
        society set that first made it fashion
        able. Placing the Hindu scripture*,
        the Bhagavadlota, or the Persian
        scriptures, the Zend Avesta, above
        their Bibles are many women who
        were formerly predestined Baptists

        by grace, established Episcopalians.
        Catholics who said their rosaries, anti
        daughters of Abraham from an un
        broken line of the Jewish faith.
        "It is the promise of eternal youth
        that attracts woman to yoga, th?
        promise which is found entertwlned
        with most of the pagan religion. Thi»
        yoga philosophy opens the door to
        subtle mysteries. The Yogi, as the
        student who masters it is termed, is
        promised the dominance of natural
        law. Incidentally there is offered
        also health and long life and the pow
        er to stay the ravages of time. 7s it
        not enough to tempt the feminine
        mind from paradise itself?
        Sprung From Pagan Soil.
        "Small wonder that a Swami's fol
        lowing, while it includes notably here
        and there college professors and men
        of learning come to investigate a
        science brought from the roof of ths
        world recruits its largest numbers
        among women. But yoga is a dan
        gerous knowledge to lure any but the
        best balanced brain. In the pursuit
        of it, too often the listening devotee is
        offering her sacrifices even at the al
        tar of her soul.
        "The imported religions of the
        orient that sow the subtle seeds of
        destruction, are offered to the un
        iuitiate as beautiful philosophies. On
        the surface they are that. Hut they
        are inevitably sprung from the sell
        of paganism and are tinctured with
        its practices.
        "It Is not that the Swamis bring
        with them the hideous Images wor
        shipper at every roadside shrine in
        India Here and there, It Is true, a
        little brown god Buddha or a green
        Jade Krishna has appeared in an
        American home; but it Is undoubtedly
        used merely, so its owner will tell you,
        as an 'aid to concentration' in tho
        worship of the ideal that it represents.
        "A greater menace than that of
        Image worship lurks in the teachings
        of the Hindu mystics. The casi>al ob
        server will not discover It. Only
        those who reach the inner circles be
        come acquainted with the mysteries
        revealed to the adepts. And the des
        cent from Christianity to heathenism
        is by such easy stages that the novice
        scarcely realizes she is led.
        Followers Number Thousands.
        "How many are followers of the
        new gods it Is difficult to estimate
        with exactness. It is known, how
        ever, that their numbers are in the
        thousands. The Vedanta society es
        tablished in America by the Swami
        Vivekenanda of popular memory, has
        its headquarters at 135 West Eightieth
        street. New York, where his successor,
        tho Swami Abhedenanda, lectures to
        audiences of from 300 to 500 people.
        “Branch societies with Swamis in
        charge are maintained in Boston.
        Pittsburg, Washington. St. Louis, Den
        ver. San Francisco and Los Angeles,
        to say nothing of the circles in many
        small towns.
        "That the sun may do its perfect
        work, the cult encourages the wear
        ing of as little clothing literally as
        the law allows. It is Anthony Com
        stock’s prying supervision that has.
        hampered the full exercise of the
        faith in New' York. But on Lowell
        lawns, sun baths and dew baths in
        'angel robes'—and. as has been testi

        ‘What has paganism done for the

        Lafayette, Ind.—It is tbe high priv
        ilege of all to follow Individual taste
        in the matter of religious belief, but
        sometimes the result Is deplorable in
        the extreme. Not all can think alike
        as regards the here and the bereaft
        er, on this all-important matter of man
        and his final destiny, but in spite of
        this diversity of opinion all good men
        and women will deeply sympathize
        with a family where the wife and
        mother has deliberately left her home
        to follow after a Btrange god. Such a
        regrettable Instance has Just been
        brought to light through the granting
        of a divorce to President Wlnthrop E.
        Stone, of Purdue university, who is
        given the custody of a minor child,
        Henry Stone, on the ground of aban
        donment
        The course of this tragedy which
        has brought deep sorrow to the Stone
        family 1B told in a pathetic story
        dating back three years, when a class
        in "Yoga philosophy" was organized
        in Lafayette. Many women and men
        in college Joined the class, which be
        came a fad in social circles. It was
        taught that a complete fulfillment of
        "Yoga philosophy" Involved the sep
        aration from family, friends and kind
        red, Mrs. Stone became a devout fol
        lower of this faith and left home.
        When last heard from In an authentic
        way she was in Germany, but has been
        reported since that she hasjeft that
        country for Kabakon, a South Sea Is
        land, to Join a colony of followers of
        the new belief. In the island where
        Mrs. Stone is supposed to be its mem
        bers are called sun worshipers.
        This colony Is one of the queerest
        In the world. It was founded several
        years ago by August Englehardt and
        numbers fewer than 100 persons. They
        live almost entirely on cocoanuts. The
        clothing they wear is said to be of the
        variety and quality affected by the
        I
        WNrMtor jr- aroME-
        natives of the South Sea islands who
        have not come in contact with the
        civilizing influences of the mission
        aries.
        Owing to the trouble with bis wife
        Mr. Stone recently sent his resigna
        tion to the trustees of Purdue, but
        they unanimously declined to accept
        It. He has been a capable bead of the
        university since 1900.
        It was no emotional. Impulsive ac
        tion that? took Mrs. Stone from her
        family. Her course was deliberate,
        and she followed it after long reflec
        tion and, apparently, after having
        counted the full cost.
        Most singular Is the story of Mrs.
        Stone's fall under the spell of the mys
        terious Yoga cult. For years she bad
        been reading theosophy and kindred
        subjects, and was mildly interested in
        them. It was along about this time
        that Dr. George Moulton organised in
        Lafayette a class In the Yoga philoso
        phy. Many women and some men. In
        West Lafayette, tha college town,
        joined the class, and it became a great
        fad with certain highly educated peo
        ple. Moultpn taught that the Yoga phil
        osophy was tbe religion of tbe Indian
        Yogi, or Soothsayers.
        One of the leading features of this
        doctrine was that of the "withdrawal,"
        or separation from kindred and
        friends. It was this feature that at
        last fastened Itself upon Mrs. Stone as
        subsequent events showed. Meetings
        of Dr. Moulton's class were held in
        several homes. Books on the subject
        were put in the hands of Mrs. Stone
        and other members of the class, and
        their interest grew.
        Radical and revolutionary as were
        the books of the cult. Dr. Moulton
        seemed to go still beyond them, and
        I evolve a Yoga philosophy of his own.
        I But the members of the class were
        warned not to make public any of the
        1
        private and secret instructions of how
        to send telepathic messages, how to
        l.ypnotlza. how to use the key of Kar
        I ma Yoga, and how to heal the sick.
        I One of the injunctions In this respect
        was "Do not become a laughing stock
        for your friends by telling tbem what
        you can do or how you do It."

      THE YELLOW MAR.
      To the mind that feeds on yellow Journalism
      as a steady diet the war situation must seem
      Just now somewhat blurred and indefinite. The
      Junior yellow appears lo have withdrawn its
      I trained corps of word-painters, fiction writers
      and inspired artists from Cuba, where they WOW
      encased In expelling Spanish tyranny from the
      island by bringing to bear upon lt all the re
      ' sources of the American language, accompanied
      I by woodcuts of great power from Fox's "Book
      I of Martyrs," and to have addressed Itself to
      i the enterprise of conveying to a public, quiver
      i iny with expectancy, the very latest and most
      1 ciiiiions u tiera noes of tin* two gentlemen of
      J chivalrous renown who contemplate settling
      i presently at Carson, Nev., In the presence of
      j larne gate-money, the momentous question,
      j "Who's who?" Overcoming Its natural desire
      I to do good by stealth, the Junior yellow has per
      ' milted the public to be informed hy means of
      headlines and large type, fo that Its accuracy
      cannot be questioned, inst it has copyrighted
      both gladiators at enormous expense, and at
      tiie sacrifice of its most cherished political con?
      victions secured a monopoly of their intellc'iual
      processes during the period of preparation. By
      this means its readers will be enabled to enjoy
      by far Hie most stirring part of that grant
      tournament without incurring travelling ex?
      penses or potting out gate-money.
      Whether this change of venue is due to a con?
      viction on the part of the younger yellow that
      Christendom i? more profoundly Interested lu
      the settlement of the question "Who's who?"
      in Nevada than in the progress of the war for
      freedom in Cuba; or from its discovery that, as
      matters dow stand, if this country should de?
      clare war against .**pain it would be solely on
      account of the detention of the correspondent of
      Its rival, the older yellow which would be sim?
      ply disgusting or because ihe older yellow,
      practising the amenities of yellow Journalism,
      has corrupted and taken into its own service the
      younger yellow's Cuban word-pa inter, ls not yet
      known. The bare, cold feet is that the younger
      yellow has transferred its enterprise from Cuba
      to Nevada, and established in the latter liv
      means of copyrights and iron-bound contract!
      with the gladiators-a monopoly of news from
      that Interesting contra of InteOlgenoe. it must
      not be for a moment supposed tlint on this ac?
      count the readers of the older yellow will be
      left in darkness as to the movements, lind?
      ie.mal and physical, of the heroes upon whoa
      the interest of the votaries of yellow journalism
      is centred. It already lias a corps of its own
      word-painters on the ground, whom no copyright
      nor contract can deter from saying "Good morn
      i?K"' or "How are ye"/" every day to each gladi?
      ator, and who know their business well enough
      to put Into well-watered and amplified yellow
      Journal American what their contracts compel
      then to omit saying. The gladiators will, of
      course, repudiate it the next day in the younger
      yellow in very large type. This will donbtleSf
      be kept up until the deilsive day arrives. And
      the odds are about 10 to l' th.it the Ugh! between
      the yellows will be more bloodcurdling and
      heart-rending than tbs fight between the gladi?
      ators.
      Meantime the senior yellow, having secured
      the services of tho younger yellow's Cuban word
      painter and being in sole possession of that BeM
      of enterprise, ls diligently preparing for war
      It will either declare war or discharge Its word
      painters and melt up its large type. The word

        TRIED LARCENY,
        BUT GOT LEFT.
        Yellow Journalism Resorts
        to Theft to Secure "Call"
        News.
        An Emissary Sent by It to
        Steal an Early Copy of a
        Live Paper.
        The Eearstling Chased to His Den,
        Given a Licking and Despoiled
        of His Booty.
        Ordinarily yellow journalism does not j
        desire to be hampered by facts, butyester- j
        day morning the Examiner actually j
        wanted some news. It did not essay to j
        procure this by honorable means, but re- j
        sorted to criminal deception and ruffianly
        force. It did not get the news, but it
        made a little, and here it is:
        In quest of information, the saffron
        freak naturally turned to The Call. It
        ■wanted a copy of a live paper fresh from
        the press. At 3:30 a. m., \V. R. Biitt, a
        reporter employed on the Examiner,
        walked into The Call mailing-rooms; on
        Clay street, and remarked to J. A. Gaugh
        eran, a carrier on one of the Potrero
        routes, thai he would lise 10 get a copy of
        the paper.
        Gaugtieran and Britt have known each
        other for a long time, and the latter
        added: "I want to see what the paper
        says about the Supervisors, as my father
        is a member of the old board. The .Call
        has all the news. I have been on The
        ("all ever «nee Mr. Mansfield came
        over. ' ,
        Perhaps it is unnecessary to state that
        Mr. .britt was uttering an untruth; but
        Gaugheran, unaccustomea to tiie wiles of
        yellow journalism, did not suspect this,
        and Britt got the paper he asked for, still
        d:mp from the press. :
        Tiien the young man vanished, but not
        until his cbortle of glen had aroused the
        interest of F. H. Shelton, superintendent
        of the mailing department, who looked in
        the direction that Britt had taken, and
        espied him legging merrily up Clay street.
        At the corner of Montgomery he jumped
        into a hack, the door of which stood open.
        The vehicle rattled off toward the den of
        the Hearstiings.
        The young men of The Call lost no
        time in considering tne ethical status of
        yellow journalism's tactics, but put off in
        pursuit of Hearst's agent. They had
        more at stake than the hackdriver had,
        and, although the vehicle moved rapidly,
        they sprinted a bit themselves, and ar
        rived at the Mission- street entrance of the
        Examiner cdit 01 ia! rooms almost as soon
        as the reporter and his booty.
        Britt took a leap from the still moving
        hack and bounded up the stairway. The
        Call man just behind and gaining ai
        every step. Up the first flight, the sec
        ond, the third, and then Britt came to a
        sudden stop. The door was locked.
        Whether to keep dishonest people out or
        to keep them in it matters not. The
        chase was at an end.
        Briit is proud of his qualities as a
        fighter, and turning at bay proceeded to
        display them. A righthander from the
        Potrero carrier knocked the r&gt;nde out of
        him and interfered with tne display.
        Several swift punches more made Britt
        relinquish the paper. With the recovered
        property in hand. The Call boys started
        down the stairs, six steps at a bound, with
        an Examiner gang in full cry after them.
        The uproar had alarmed the establish
        ment. Britt's shouts for help had reached
        the ears of the crowd waiting to receive
        the spoils of the larcenous raid he had
        made and they poured out ready lor a
        battle.
        In the street there wai another struggle.
        Britt bad caught some of the wind pre
        viously knocKed out of him ana fought
        desperately to resteal the copy of The
        Call. Police whistles were blown, a mob
        collected and officers came on the ran.
        Shelton found himself in the arms of a
        policeman, who released him when told
        that somebody had tried to hold some
        body up, which was the case. By this
        time Gaughernn, with the torn and
        bloody paper, was making Jong strides
        for Clay street. The paper was delivered
        in triumph to the superintendent of the
        mailing-room and is now in possession of
        The Call.
        Diligent inquiry yesterday afternoon
        established the fact beyond dispute that
        Britt was acting under orders of superior
        authority in the management of the yel
        low highbinder. At midnight a carriage
        had been hired by two Examiner men.
        They were driven first to the iloreue, then
        to tiie Comstock saloon and then to the
        Bailors' Home. From the bailors' Home
        they went to the Examiner office on Mis
        sion street. One of ihe men in the car
        riage was Britt, the other Moran.
        Tue carriage was kept in waiting in
        front of the Examiner ofiice on Mission
        street until nearly 2 o'clock, and tben
        Britt alone came down and directed the
        driverto go to a point near The Call of
        fice on Ciay street and stop tu&lt;re. The
                                            driver obeyed instructions. Britt hovered
                                            around in that neighborhood until The
                                            Call' 6 first paper came Iroin the press.
The hackman saw him coming with the
paner in hand.
"I saw him coming up Clay street on
the dead run," said the driver. "I nad
the door of tne carriage open for him.
When he jumped ia he said, ' Drive like
        to the Examiner office on Mission
        street.' I drove at full speed, but the
young fellows on foot got there as soon as
1 din. I saw them run upstairs at Britt's
        heels. There was a great racket at th«
        top of the stairs. 1 didn't know what was
        going on. Pretty soon all of them piled
        down in a heap.
        "Police whistles were sounded and a
        great crowd gathered. After the excite
        ment I was dismissed. I asked to whom
        the hack should be charged, and was told
        to charge it to W. R. Britt of tne Ex
        aminer. . .
        Now if yellow journalism wishes to copy
        any more news irom The Call this is f he
        opportunity.

          Yellow Journalism and its Hero
          les.
          Daily States.
          Our alrays level-headed contem
          porary, the Baton Rouge Advocate,
          discourses as follows:
          The Advocate has not been in
          dulging in any raving over the es
          cape of the Cuban girl about which
          so many of the newspapers are now
          talking. WVheu the story about the
          inhumanity of the- Spanish govern
          ment towards this alleged "Cuban
          beauty" was beitag- paraded by the
          jingo newspapers for political effect
          only, a reporter interviewed Gen.
          Fitzhugh Lee, American Consul
          General at Havana, and that gen
          tleman "winked the other eye,"
          figuratively speaking, at the whole
          story. Gen. Lee is as brave, de
          termined and chivalrous as is any
          man on the American continent and
          nobody who knows him will believe
          that he would have remained quiet
          while an innocent girl was being
          prosecuted by a tyranical govern
          ment. The incident has already
          been made too much of and the
          Spanish government is likely laugh
          ing in its sleeve at the roaring two
          bit farce a few fool jingoes are
          enacting in New York and elsewhere.
          The incident will probably wind
          up by this alleged beauty capturing
          some old duck with a good deal
          more money than braiins and then
          the illusion will be dispelled and the
          fun will begin. We take no stock
          in the clap trap methods of this f
          yellow 'journalism which requires
          such impositions upon the public to
          keep up its circulation. We have
          plenty of deserving American girls -
          upon whom a small portion of the
          sympathy wasted upon this very
          questionable object of solicitation
          would be well bestowed as well' as
          being creditable to the good sense
          of our people.
          The Advocate seems to know
          that the "rescue" of the Spanish
          girl is about the biggest piece of
          humbuggery that yellow journalism
          has yet palmed off on the fool pub
          lic. Some days prior to the "res
          cue" the New York Journal osten
          tatiously announced that the Ameri
          can people demanded that Miss
          Cisneros should be liberated and
          that it, the Journal, would see that
          she was liberated. Following this
          came the news of the young wo
          man's alleged rescue fro ev
          prison" in which she h!jEW in
          carcerated by the .*bl iirsty"
          Spaniards; and finally we have the
          wholeFounu nthused with admi
          ratii' and Y York nearly wild
          in its tributes to the emancipated
          young lady. All this, we repeaj is
          afrrnt humbuggery. The Wew
          York ournal, when in its yellowest
          robes, shouted, .*she shall be faree,
          w what it .wasali a
          in other words it
          cirri d.Lwai kronjSpaa thi an: ny
          thorities soon diiaeoered this fact;
          but what wert.' they AI do about. it?
          The Spaniards are proud, stubborn
          and remorseless; yet they did not
          exile her, as wa s.the purpose so
          alleged, and they were too proud
          and stubborn to acknowledge the
          mistake. Thus they had a white
          elephant on their binds that they
          were devilish glad to be relieved
          of. At. this juncture the New York
          Journal, doubtlessly at the sugges
          tion bf the Spanish authorities,
          drummed up its heroes, knights,
          errants and panadins and shipped
          them over to Cuba. The Spanish
          authorities turned their blind sides
          on Miss Cisneros and heroic ies
          curers; the latter strung a ladder
          from the roof of an adjoining build
          ing to the prisoner's window. The
          guards being conveniently deaf, a
          heavy iron bar was rent in twain,
          and out sprang the beautiful victim
          of Spanish cruelty.
          This we believe to be the whole
          story, and we repeat that the noise
          that has been made over it is another
          triumph for the yellowest sort of
          journalism. Miss Cisneros is no
          doubt quite grateful to the boys and
          so also are the Queen and the Span
          ish authorities.
          We trust that now, in the first
          blush of public enthusiasm over
          her daring rescue, the young wo
          man will have common sense
          enough to reap all the profit she can
          from the occasion. In accordance
          with the American habit, in a few
          weeks she will be forgotten, and
          unless she heels herself while the
          Americans are in a fool state of
          miad she will' when the reaction sets
          n find Jordan a hard road to travel.

          EXCITEMENT IS NOW ABATED.
          The General Impression Now Is That the Maine Catas
          trophe Was the Result of an Accident.
          Summary of Result The New York Journal Still Says It Was Dne to
          Treachery and Offers a Large Reward Vlxcaya la
          New York Coart of Inquiry.
          Washington, Feb. 19. The
          excitement over the sinking of
          the Maine has greatly abated.
          When the morning parers from
          all over the country commenced
          to come in they showed .from
          expert testimony that spontan
          eous combustion in the coal in
          bunkers of other vessels often
          occurred and in the case of our
          war vessel it was piled up on
          the sides, which would contrib
          ute to the obstruction of a shot
          from th outside.
          The general impressiou here
          this evening is that the catas
          trophe is due to an accident on
          board the ship, and that the ac
          cident was caused by the coal
          igniting from spontaneous com
          bustion or from the change m
          the character of the gun cottou
          on board. It is given out by
          the highest authorities that this
          high and powerful explosive,
          which is used for torpedoes,
          sometimes uudergoes chemical
          changes which make it explode
          purely through such changes.
          The officers of the navy and
          congress are much disturbed
          over the unfortunate affair from
          a standpoint other than that
          the Spaniards might have had
          something to do with it.
          Total officers and men on
          board the Maine, 355; total offi
          cers, 26; total men, 329; total
          officers saved. 24; total men
          saved. 76; total officers lost, 2;
          total men lost, 246; total offi
          cers injured, none; total men
          injured, 57; doubtful (.sen) 7.
          The seven appearing a3
          doubtful probably represent
          that number, or less, whose
          lives have been saved, but who
          cannot be identified at present
          on account of errors in the
          transmission of telegrams.
          The fifty-seven appearing as
          injured are included in the sev
          enty-five appearing as saved.
          Two men reported as having
          died in hospital are included in
          the total 246 reported as lost.
          REWAED OF $50,000.
          New York, Feb. 19. The
          Journal has deposited $50,000
          with Wells. Fargo &amp; Co., to be
          given as a reward for the de
          tection of the perpetrator of the
          Maine outrage, whether "per
          son, persons or government."
          The Journal has decided to
          its own satisfaction that tb
          iuaine was Diown up by an
          enemy.
          To the Maine's Victims.
          Death came out o. black night's deep.
          And steered for a battleship's side;
          But never a man of the sailors' clan
          Looked on the Deathman's ride.
          The Kansan lad and the Hampshire boy.
          And the boy from Tennessee,
          With never a fear that death was near.
          Swung into eternity.
          Nor flag, nor shot, nor battle cry.
          Nor strain of the nation's air.
          Broke into the gloom of the sailor's doom.
          Nor yet a priestly prayer.
          There looks a face from faraway home.
          With eye bent ou the sea.
          For the Hampshire Jack who'll not come back.
          Or the lad from Tennessee.
          Not theirs is the glory of battle;
          No victory crowns the day.
          But a nation weeps that the dark sea keeps
          Her dead beneath the bay.
          This is about the end of the
          matter unless Spain does some
          thing to offend Uncle Sam in a
          lay or two aud the investiga
          tion does not show that the ves
          sel was sunk from outside
          sources.
          The high pitch of excitement
          throughout the country can be
          appreciated when it is said that
          the president has received tele
          grams from every quarter indi
          cating the disposition of the
          people to rush into war if he
          will but say the word, and off
          ering troops. It would look as
          if the expressed sympathy of
          Spain with our country on this
          matter and the conduct of the
          people of Havana in the bury
          ing of the dead yesterday would
          have the effect of bringing the
          two countries nearer together
          than of setting them wider
          apart.
          SUMMAKY OF RESULT.
          Washington, Feb. 19. The
          navy department has compiled
          the following summary of the
          results of the Maine disaster
          from all official ir formation up
          to the close of the department
          tonight:
          VIZCAYA REACHES NEW YORK.
          New York, Feb. 19. The
          Spanish armored cruiser Viz
          caya is in New York waters.
          She dropped her big anchor
          five miles south of Sandy Hook
          lightship at 5:30 p. m., after a
          thirteen days' voyage from the
          Canary islands. When her offi
          cers and men learned the start
          ling news of the Maine disaster
          and the downfall of former Min
          ister De Lome, they broke into
          a? wild uproar of talk. For a
          couple of minutes all discipline
          on the great ship seemed to
          vanish, while men rushed below
          to tell their comrades on the
          lower decks.
          Early tomorrow morning the
          Vizcaya will come ud to the an
          chorage selected for her in the
          upper bay.

          graphs that the court of inquiry
          will meet today and probably
          will visit Havana on Monday.
          They are at Key West. Noth

          ONE MORE YELLOW FREAK
          MADRID, March 18.— General
          Weyler denies the authenticity of
          the letter published in the New
          York Journal yesterday in which
          the former Captain General of
          Cuba is alleged to have said the
          United States would not have
          dared to send a warship to Ha
          vana while he was in command
          there, as "they knew the terrible
          punishment that awaited them,"
          adding that he had Havana har
          bor "well prepared for such an
          * emergency," having "rapidly fln
          * ished the work Martinez Campos
          * carelessly abandoned."
          * HAVANA, March 18.— Last
          * night a correspondent saw Don
          * Francisco de los Guzman, to
          * whom General Weyler is alleged
          * to have written a letter pub
          * lished in the New York Journal
          * yesterday, apparently suggesting
          * the destruction of the United
          * States battlf-ship Maine. The
          * former President of the Cortes
          * was much surprised when asked
          * if he had received such a letter.
          * He said: "I have not received
          * any such letter from General
          * Weyler and for that reason it is
          * impossible for any one to have
          * stolen such a letter from me. I
          * am ignorant of the existence of
          * such a letter and consequently
          * of its alleged contents."

          ON BOARD THE DISPATCH DOAT TRI
          TON , Hound ( or Key West. May 13. ( New-
          York World Cablegram Special Telegram. )
          The American troops have fought their
          flrst light on Cuban soil and they have won.
          There were not many of them landed from
          tbc transport Gussle for /ie Initial conflict ,
          but they went Into the fight with a will
          and there was no question as to the result.
          This Is the first encounter of American
          troops with n foreign force on Its own
          ground In many a year and It proves con
          clusively their bravery.
          The landing party that stood on Cuban
          poll this morning shot to kill , and It shot
          well. The Spaniards left three of their dead
          behind them , which is unusual , and shows
          the haste with which they were compelled
          to abandon the position they had occupied.
          The Americans lost not a man and not one
          of the landing force was seriously wounded.
          The best proof of the good showing made
          by the bluecoats Is the fact that they were
          taken utterly by surprise , but stood their
          ground like veterans , although many of
          them were smelling powder for the flrst
          time In their lives.
          The fight occurred on the shore of the
          harbor of Cabanas. It had been arranged
          to send couriers to the Cuban leaders to
          convey plans proposed by the American gen
          erals. It was most Important that the dis
          patches should reach their destination and
          a special force was selected to protect the
          couriers until they were placed In safety
          on Cuban soil. It was known before start
          ing from Key West that the whole north
          coast of Cuba was dotted with the Spanish
          forces. In small companies they could be
          found anywhere and It was possible for
          them to concentrate a large force at short
          notice. From the city of Havana to Ca
          banas , In the province ot Plnar del Rio ,
          there is not a stone ruin or cave that is
          not the rendezvous of from 200 to 300 of
          the Spanish Infantry. The shore line Is
          guarded from end to end and it is almost
          on Impossibility for a vessel to approach
          the coast without being discovered. The
          landing of couriers or small forces , or even
          considerable amounts of ammunition , can
          therefore best be done at night.
          Lenta * Ker Went.
          Such was the plan of Captain Dorst , who
          was in command of the present expedition.
          He is commander of company E of the First
          United States infantry , and he had his own
          men with him. The couriers and troops
          were carried by the transport Gussle. Thin
          is a venerable side-wheeler of Mississippi
          river glory. It did not reach Key West
          until 5 p , m. yesterday , although it was ex
          pected It would .get there much sooner , and
          Captain Dorst bad arranged to leave Key
          West not later than 6 p. ra. There were
          other mistakes In the arrangements , and It
          was 9 p. m. before a start was finally made.
          The One armed revenue cutter Manning led
          the expedition. It went ahead' with only its
          sfcrn light showing , for the guidance of the
          Qussle , which was towed out of the harbor
          by the dispatch boat Triton. Not another
          vessel was near and not another was per
          mitted by the regulations to leave the har
          bor. It was all done in the quiet and dark
          ness of night.
          The troops of the Gussle were exceedingly
          happy. They were thoroughly tired of railroading
          reading across the continent and the dole
          ful camping at Tampa. To their minds any
          change was acceptable. Those bluecoats are
          all westerners and they chafe under the
          restraint of camp life. They were glad they
          had been given the honor of engaging in
          the dangerous expedition. But it was not
          happy weather. In less than an hour after
          the start had been made the rain began to
          fall. It came down In sheets and it was im
          possible to ECO mure than a cable's length
          ahead. The Manning disappeared in the
          darkness and Captain Dorst balled the Tri
          ton to carry to the Manning the announce
          ment of a change In the plans that had been
          made necessary by the delay at Key West.
          The Manning's stern light could not be
          Been and It was Impossible to do anything
          tut steam back to the Gusslo with its
          anxious commander. He heard the word ,
          and the answer came ringing back : "All
          right. Take jour course. We'll go ahead
          on ours. " It was 9:20 : n. m. , when the north
          coast of Cuba was reached. The Manning
          was now again sighted , having laid to In
          wait for its convoy. It steamed ton _ posi
          tion abeam the Gussle and then they turned
          westward toward the port of Cabanas , with
          the Triton in close company.
          SiinnUh Troop * Slithled.
          The lookouts en the Triton were the first
          to sight Spanish , troops on tne shore , and
          the Information was promply conveyed to
          the Manning. Its crew went to quarters
          with the agility of acrobats. Tbc captain
          of tbc Manning was patient. The guns
          were shotted , but there were no orders to
          fire , although there could be plainly seen
          the bead of a Spanish column emerging
          upon a yellow road leading from the brush
          down to the beach. The gunners waited.
          The captain could not be sure whether the
          loldlers were hostile Spanish or friendly
          Cubans. The vessels drew nearer the shore
          and then it was easy to distinguish the light
          blue uniforms and straw hats that mark the
          Spaniards from the Cubans in their mud-
          colored dress. Still It was not time for
          hooting and the Manning forged ahead.
          The captain remarked that be would she.ll
          that force on the return trip , and it is prob
          able that it bos before this time felt the
          weight ot American projectiles.
          It was 11 a. m. when the Manning and
          thi ) Quisle passed Marlel .the head of Wey-
          ler's famous trocha. Just west of this har
          bor the coast hills rise high , and It was
          easy with glasses to distinguish bodies of
          cavalry moving along their edges. Twenty
          minutes later the Gussle slowed up off a
          atrln of sand that seemed a likely place to
          put the couriers ashore and tend their
          horses swimming after them. The Gussle
          and Manning steamed In toward the chore.
          In plain sight were four Spanlth cavalry
          scouts and the suns were trained on them.
          There was a discharge and the scouts hur
          ried bac &gt; Into the buthrs. They were
          armed will' Mauser rifles and the ships w re
          .well within tbelr rang * , but the Spanish
          aim was bad and no bloodshed followed their
          flre. U was the flrst small aria episode of
          the present war and It formed a tiny prel
          ude to the heavier skirmish that was soon
          to follow.
          Those on the Gussle had made prepara
          tions for disembarking , but these were
          stopped as soon as the firing began. The
          Cuban couriers had no desire to land jn a
          nest ot their enemies , and Captain Dorst
          agreed that they were right. He gave or
          ders for further steaming westward and no
          stop was then made until Punta Frla , the
          harbor entrance of Cabanas , was reached.
          This was the landing place that had been
          flrst selected. It was about 1 p. m. when
          the lookouts sighted a large stone-walled ,
          roofless sugar mill that was seen to be
          jammed and fringed with the Inevitable men
          In tbe blue coats and straw hats. Tbe cap
          tain of the Manning signaled : "Shall I
          shell them ? " Captain Dorst replied with
          pleasure.
          Mnnnlnir Open * Flre.
          The gun crews on the Manning had been
          at quarters for nearly three hours and they
          were restless. In fact , they have not hod
          their guns very long and they wanted a
          chance to use them. Their first shots were
          unsteady and apparently did no damage.
          There were no dust jets from the stone
          masonry , but It was seen that the Spanish
          troops deemed It best to evacuate. When
          Punta Frla was reached the veteran Cuban
          coast pilot Blanco cautiously dropped the
          unwleldly Gussle in shore until it lay 300
          yards from the beach. Tha brush back of
          the sand was so dense that it was Impossible
          to find an opening In it with glasses. In
          front of the brush there was a coral reef
          with long rollers breaking over It. In the
          distance to the south lay the misty Gosi
          bcrnado hills , to which tbe Cuban couriers
          were bound. To the southeast , two miles
          away , was the town of Cabanas , filled with
          Spanish troops. There was danger everya
          where.
          The Gussle's anchor was dropped over ;
          board , which seemed to be the signal tor
          firing from the shore. From the eastern
          side of the harbor entrance possibly 2,000
          yards away , there came a heavy rifle flre.
          The weapons again were Mausers and the
          ships were In range , but not a bullet struck
          the Gussle. Occasionally there were heavier
          discharges , as If from the old style guns , but
          it was impossible to make out any forces.
          One of the Gussle's long boats was launched ,
          no one paying any attention to the firing.
          Six soldier oarsmen and a soldier coxswain
          made the crew. No one knows where these
          California fighters learned to row , but they
          do it well. Captain Dorst was short of
          boats and ho requested tbe Triton to help
          In putting the couriers on shore. There
          were two of them with a guide.
          Captain Donator Soto , who * was formerly
          with Maceo , Is in charge of the expedition
          and with him Is his secretary , Antonio
          Maria Canns. Tbelr guide Is Podron. They
          carry the latest official news of the war and
          instructions for the future to General Pedro
          Diaz , who commands the Insurgent forces
          in the province of Plnar del Rio. There
          were hushed moments while the boats were
          going through the surf to the shore. On
          the deck of the Gussle were men with ready
          rifles pointed to the brush back of the
          beach. Captain Pflster stood ready to com
          mand them to flre. Lieutenant Tracy was
          half way up the shrouds peering down upon
          the tangled undergrowth. But not a Span
          lard was to be seen. The long boats reached
          the shore and the couriers jumped out upon
          the beach.
          Soldier * Go Ahore.
          The bluecoats followed them , the first
          men. to land on the flrst fighting day be
          tween American and Spanish soldiers. About
          100 yards down tbe beach there was a smal
          clump of trees , back of which the brush
          was very dense. It looked like a good lurkIng -
          Ing place for .expectant Spanish soldiers ,
          and it was. They were in safe ambush and
          watched the Americans land.
          A second boatload started from the Gus-
          sto and quickly made tbe beach. In al
          there were twenty American sailors on Cu
          ban ground. Some of the men started for
          ward to beat the bush in true Indian fash
          ion. They had scarcely reached tbe jungle
          when there came tbe sharp crack of Mau
          sers , followed by tbe quick whistling o
          bullets. U was just 2DO : p. m. and tbc
          fight was on.
          The men on the Gussle poured a steady fir *
          Into the trees and shrubbery. The Spanish
          fire became hotter , but none the less wild
          bullets whirred everywhere. To the men
          on the Gussie It seemed there must be a i
          whole column of Spaniards in tbe ambush.
          The Americans who had gone forward to
          scout could not be seen. In five minutes
          they came tumbling back upon the beach
          The firing was incessant. Captain Dors
          tried to signal for the Manning and tbi
          auxiliary yacht Wasp to come and shell thi
          Spanish position , but there was a delay. The
          men on the beach kept up their flre , al
          though It looked as if they were opposed by
          at least 400.
          Finally the -Manning got Into range an &lt;
                opened fire. At flrst its shells bunt half a
                mile beyond the Spanish position , but thi
          was soon corrected and the deadly pro
          jectlles struck where they were directed.
          Cuptaln Poster's marksmen on , the deck o :
          the Gussle shot magnificently , and In less
          than ten minutes the Spanish flre ceased

          bold.

          The men on the shore , under command o
          Captain O'Donnell , had meantime been hav
          ing a hot time , notwithstanding the pro
          tcctlon they received from the flre from th
          ships. The captain'had placed his men
          well. About fifty yards Inland from th
          point where the second boatload landed
          lived a fisherman. He was also a charcoal
          burner and In a small clearing in front o :
          his cabin had completed an excavation tea
          a new kiln. It made a splendid rifle pi
          and Captain T. O'Donnell posted most of hi
          men there. Their steady flre did inuc
          towards driving the Spaniards from tbcl
          position.
          When the enemy's flre ceased scouts wen
          sent forward to make sure that tb
          Spaniards had retired. It was dlscoverci
          that they had moved further Inland touan
          their block house.
          I.cnve Tlielr Dead Behind.
          The dead they left behind were a lleuten
          ant and two privates. Captain Dorst or
          dered a recall and went ashore in person
          to superintend the re-embarkation , Thi
          couriers mounted , shook hands and gal
          loped down the beach on their perilous
          journey to the Gobernado Hills. They bai
          borne themselves well In the enrounter.

          as fallen at last. The flag of Cuba Is float *
          ng over it. It Is now the headquarters of
          Garcla's army of eastern Cuba. The story
          f Its occupation by the victorious Cubans
          was brought to Key West by Lieutenant
          \ndrews Rowan of the Nineteenth United
          States Infantry , who arrived from Nassau
          I .oday off the schooner Fearless. Immedl-
          I nl tcly after the Independence of the Cubans
          lad been recognized by congress three of-
          icers of the army were detailed by the
          ureau of military Investigation to visit ,
          Cuba , hold conferences with the Insurgent
          eaders in different parts of the Island and
          eport to the War department the number of
          men or the amount of ammunition that each
          wanted. Colonel Dorst has already turned
          a largo amount of rifles and gunpowder over
          ti o Perlco Dclgado In western Cuba and
          will land a great deal more before the Gus-
          si le returns to Key West.
          Lieutenant Whitney was detailed to visit
          General Gomez In central Cuba. For some
          r eoson &lt; he has not yet started on his mission
                    and ; at last accounts was still aboard the
          Ii ndtana awaiting dispatches from Washlng-
          on. Lieutenant Rowan was the third man.
          The lieutenant Is an excellent type of the
          | American army officer , broad shouldered ,
          | S1 un burned and good naturcd. A corrc-
          pondcnt found Lieutenant Rowan on the
          deck of the Fearless Just as It was cnter-
          ng Key West harbor. He wore the peaked
          anaraa hat of the Cuban army and the high
          i u aced leggings In which he had tramped
          tl hrough miles of Cuban underbrush.
          In a little sailboat , accompanied by two
          Cuban guides and a crew of five men , I.leu-
          enont Rowan slipped out of a bay on tbc
          north shore of Jamaica at 1:30 on the morn-
          ng of April 26. He landed on tbc south
          coast of Cuba at a point between Santiago
          and : OJo del Toro. After n long and weary
          march across a mountain Lieutenant
          Rowan's guides succeeded in capturing
          tl : hree horses , and the party continued on Its
          hunt for Garcia.
          Ilnvnino Eracnnted.
          "We had expected to find Garcia en
          camped somewhere In the fields or moun-
          t alns ! , " said the lieutenant. "Imagine our
          surprise to learn that bU headquarters were
          h n Bayamo. That I had always regarded as
          one ot the strongest Spanish fortified towns.
          But such was the case. Bayamo has been tn
          a state of partial siege for months. Garcia I
          simply worried the Spanish out. On the 24th |
          of April , while flags were hoisted over every
          Spanish fort around Bayamo General Garcia
          was correct In his supposition that the
          Spanish did not intend an armistice , but
          simply hoisted a flag of truce to cover
          treacherously some military maneuver. Tbat
          maneuver was the evacuation of Bayamo
          The Cubans answered the flags of truce
          with a heavy artillery and rifle fire. The
          Spanish retreated in two columns to a' little
          town called Embarcadero on the Cauto
          river. For a distance of 200 yards on the
          San Augustln road the Cubans planted dyna
          mite torpedoes that were exploded by an
          electric wire from the underbrush.
          "From what I have learned of the affair
          I believe that three entire companies ot
          Spaniards and three pieces of artillery were
          literally blown to pieces. General Garcla's
          headquarters are In one of the finest bouses
          In Bayamo. He received me most kindly
          and gave all the information that was In
          his power. The obtaining of that Informa
          tion was my official errand , so that I am not
          at liberty to tell you what It was , but I bei i
          lleve that I shall be able to tell the State |
          department all that they desired to know
          about the eastern end of Cuba. Garcia wants
          American soldiers as well as rifles and am-
          munition. He Is very kindly disposed toward -
          ward Americans personally and his whole
          army Is at the disposal of the United States
          government In Washington.
          Excellent Gallic * .
          "Cuban soldiers arc not much to look at
          but they are the best guides I have ever
          seen. Their endurance and resourcefulness
          are something wonderful. I don't believe in
          sending them Kragg-Jorgensen rifles. The
          Remington is better adapted to their use
          than any Bother. It is simpler and is mon
          easily repaired.
          "After leaving Garcia I kept on to the
          northward and crossed the island. With
          two guides , I explored the north coast. There
          are several harbors that are remarkably
          well fitted for the purpose. The Cubans are
          not only willing but are anxious to give us
          all the land we want for permanent coaling
          stations. They look upon the presence of
          the fleet In their waters as a continual pro-
          tectlon. "
          With Lieutenant Rowan were Genera !
          Collazo and Colonel Carlos Hernandez of
          Garcla's staff. Collazo was Insurgent mili
          tary governor of Bayamo when the Cubans
          entered it. He bad with him a copy of the
          order he Issued at the time. "Any persons
          caught robbing or plundering the town , '
          the order says , "will be tried by vcrba
          court-martial , and if found guilty will be
          put to death , 'that it will serve as a good
          example. ' "
          Collazo and Hernandez will accompany
          Rowan to Tampa , where they will make a
          detailed report to General Miles.
          Among the other passengers on the Fear

          cssels of the Dying squadron , led by the
          lagshlp Brooklyn , steamed out of Hampton
          loads this afternoon , and after passing the
          t'lrglnla capes took a southern course.
          The order directing the squadron to put
          o tea came at midnight last night. A few-
          minutes later the signal "bo ready to put
          .o sea at daybreak" flashed from the flag1
          hip. In a jiffy the men were summoned
          .o the decks , and the work of making the
          hips ready to sail commenced. Then the
          men waited for the signal lo "weigh
          anchor. "
          Day broke , but the signal was not hoisted.
          The day wore on toward noon , and until the
          flag was seen small craft ran tend
          nd fro carrying dispatches. Excitement
          gave way to despair , for the men had been
          ylng off Old Point Comfort for the last six
          weeks waiting for orders to go to sea. and
          .hey were afraid they were to be dlsap-
          &gt; otnted , but not so.
          At 4 o'clock a signal ordering the battle-
          hip Massachusetts , the Texas , dispatch boat
          corplon and collier Sterling to weigh anchor
          and run was run up to the top of the Brook-
          yn's military mast.
          Thirty minutes later smoke was curling
          rom the ships , and they were plowing the
          sea at the rate of fifteen knots. Hundreds
          of people , mostly guests at the hotels , in
          cluding the wives und daughters of the of
          ficers , stood on the dock and waved god
          speed to the men who were going to do
          battle for their country.
          I'nt on Full Steam.
          The ships passed the capes at 7:15 : o'clock.
          After reaching the open sea It Is said the
          _
          vessels took the middle course , proceeding
          under full steam.
          The cruisers Minneapolis and New Or-
          cans were left behind , as was also the
          auxiliary cruiser St. Paul , which Is still
          anchored in the harbor hero taking on a
          supply of ammunition.
          At S o'clock tonight trie Minneapolis
          hauled up its anchors and steamed out at I
          i
          ull rpeed to overtake the squadron. Late
          his evening Captain Slgsbee received orders
          to proceed at midnight. The St. Paul will
          '
          oln the New Orleans nt Old Point Comfort ,
          and both vessels will then put to sea. They ,
          are expected to overtake Commodore Schley
          some time tomorrow evening , or early Sunday -
          day morning.
          The fact that the Sterling , laden with
          4,000 tons of coal , accompanied tbe fleet ,
          indicates that a long sail is contemplated.
          Commodore Schley left under scaled orders.
          WASHINGTON , May 13. Secretary of the
          Navy Long this morning received official ad
          vices from Martinique , Windward islands ,
          that the Spanish squadron had been sighted
          to the westward of. that Island. .Martinique
          is about COO miles in a southerly direction
          from San Juan ; Porto Rico , where the Amerli
          lean squadron under Admiral Sampson was |
          in action yesterday. The Spanish vessels off
          Martinique compose the formidable squadron
          recently collected at the Cape Verde islands ,
          and which sailed from there in a westerly
          direction two weeks ago today.
          Upon receipt of this Information Secre
          tary Long ordered Commodore Schley , at
          Hampton Roads , to put to sea at once with
          the flying squadron , and it will sail today.
          While Its destination Is not known , it is be
          lieved that the squadron has been sent in
          pursuit of the Spanish squadron.

          BERLIN , May 13. ( New York World
          Cablegram Special Telegram. ) The new-
          situation created by the American occu
          pancy ot the Philippines is the subject of
          the leading articles In this morning's news
          papers , which may be summarized as fol
          lows : America must either bold them her
          self or transfer them to a European power.
          Their recession to Spain is impossible. It is
          equally Impossible that they should remain
          In the hands ot the native Insurgents. Signs
          are multiplying that the people In authority ,
          In the United States will decide to retain the
          Islands as an American possession , notwlth-
          standing the fact that this will eventually
          entail on the American people the necessity
          of maintaining a larger army and navy and
          will bring nearer the danger of Imbroglios
          with European powers having large Inter
          ests in the east. England , Japan and Rus
          sia are the only possible competitors for
          tbelr possession .should America withdraw ,
          and If England became the owner the United
          States would see that she gave up the West
          Indian possessions In exchange.
          Japan would have a poor chance. Its
          competition with America in China is acute
          and the United States will do nothing to
          help them , besides they could give nothing
          in exchange. Russia and America have al
          ways been close friends , and it is just possi
          ble that America may purchase Russia's
          continued friendship by checkmating Eng
          land. This , however , Is certain. If the
          United ] States concede anything to Russia she
          Incurs at 'once the hostility of England , a
          situation , say the German papers , beset with
          .
          difficulties. A new power has sprung up
          .

          GIBRALTAR , May 13. ( New York World

          division ot the Spanish fleet , consisting ot
          he Pelayo , Carlos , Qulnto , Alfonso , Teresa ,
          lapldo , Patrla and several torpedo boats , is
          still at Cadiz. Harbor and coast lights from
          Cadiz to Malaga are suspended. Torpedo
          boats are.crutstng In the vicinity.
          CADIZ , May 13. ( New York World Ca
          blegram Special Telegram. ) The reserve
          fleet Is being slowly prepared here , Admiral
          Camara having assumed command , with
          Captain Hedlger , his major general , as Span-
          lards style him , nn active officer who has |
          shaken up all the old arsenal San Ferdlnando
          siol
          officials. The tough rear admiral Charracua ,
          also lately appointed local commander , has
          told Hedlger and Camara that It Is useless
          tttt
          ttSJ make them hurry up. The marines and
          sailors have assembled in greater numbers
          than wanted for the vessels. The govern
          ment , for political motives and to show peo-
          raPi
          pie that It is preparing to avenge the Manila
          defeat , has osked the naval authorities what
          vessels of war can be soon ready to protect
          transports carrying 6,000 men to Manila. The
          minister of war has got seven battalions and
          four batteries , ready , armed and equipped.
          Eight ships will be required. When tbc
          naval authorities reported It Impossible to
          get war vessels ready so quickly , they de
          clared that tbc battleship Pelayo was not
          fitted for an expedition to the far cast and
          that it was wanted 'for a reserve squadron
          at home. For the same reason they object
          to ' part with tbe Carlos V , the battleship
          Cardinal Clsneros and Alpbonso XIII , first
          class cruisers.They don't think second
          and third class cruisers available. Three
          In all would be enough to protect an expe
          dition against the forces Admiral Dcwcy
          will have at is disposal by the time these
          Spanish reinforcements can reach Manila.
          Tbelr destroyers , three at Cadiz and two at
          Ferrol , they want to keep for defenses ot
          the coasts , with torpedo vessels and the old
          Ironclads Numancla and Vltorln , lately re
          fitted at French arsenals at greatcost.
          Unless a popular outcry overcomes pro
          fesslonal competent objection the govern
          ment will have to abandon the idea of send
          ing a tardy relief expedition to the Philip
          pines. Navnl authorities are devoutly
          hoping that Admiral Cervera's squadron
          will avoid a flght with a superior force
          under Sampson. They lament that the four
          cruisers and three destroyers were not or
          dered to Join the reserve fleet nt Cadiz ,
          the entire fleet to make a dash for some
          North American port , then wheeling tiack
          to Spain and seriously paralyzing Amer
          ican offensive operations In the West Indies.

          grams from General Macias , captain general

          had sufficient force to resist with success
          any landing , but that notwithstanding ho
          had armed ten battalions of volunteers. The
          Spanish transatlantic steamer Alfonso XIII
          brought there many days ago more troops
          and supplies and abundance of ammunition
          and , it is believed , artillery , but there has
          been no time yet for mounting guns.
          The Paulina , which arrived on May 9 ,
          also brought provisions. It is therefore
          believed that the town can now defy a long

          not go to the rescue or the American fleet. ,

          World Cablegram Special Telegram. ) The
          British cruiser Talbot arrived here today ,
          having left Havana last Tuesday noon. The
          Talbot's officers say that the blockade o
          Havana harbor by thf &gt; American fleet is very
          effective and Is beginning to tell. Fresh
          provisions are getting very scarce In the
          city. Meat commands 75 to SO cents per
          pound. General Blanco has ordered tbe
          merchants te sell to customers not more
          than one day's supply each day.
          The American ships frequently open on
          Morro castle apparently solely for the pur
          pose of getting the correct range. Tbe pee
          pie were greatly discouraged by the news
          from the Spanish disaster at Manila. Nev
          crtheless. they declared that they would
          resist to the end.

          WASHINGTON. May 13. At 7:30 : this
          morning the Navy department received the
          'allowing dispatch from Commander Samp
          son. It is dated St. Thomas , May 12 , and Is
          as follows :
          "A portion of the squadron under my
          ommnnil reached San Juan this morning at
          &gt; o'clock. No armed vessels were found In
          ho port. As soon as It was sufficiently light
          [ commenced attack on batteries defending
          ho city. This attack lasted about three
          iiours and resulted In much damage to the
          batteries and Incidentally to a portion ot the
          city adjacent to the batteries. The battcr-
          cs replied to our flre , but without material
          ffcct. One man was killed on board the
          New York and seven slightly wounded In
          he squadron. No serious damage to any
          ships resulted. ( Signed ) SAMPSON. "

          ackcd with only a portion of his fleet Is
          taken to indicate that be did not find It
          'xpedlent ' to take the entire squadron into

          has separated the fleet. The Navy depart

          ON BOARD FLAGSHIP IOWA ( off Sail
          Juan de Porto Rico , May 12. via St. Thomas ,
          W. I. ) , May 13. The forts of Sun Juan de
          Porto Rico were bombarded by part of Rear
          Admiral Sampson's fleet this morning.
          The enemy's loss Is believed to be heavy.
          The American loss la two men killed and
          seven men Injured.
          After three hours' firing the admiral with
          drew the licet , and , heading for Key West ,
          he said :
          "I am satisfied with the morning's work.
          I could have taken San Juan , but I have no
          force to bold it. I only wanted to admin
          ister punishment. This has been done. I
          came for the Spanish fleet and not for San
          Juan. "
          The men killed were :
          SEAMAN FRANK WIDEMARK of the
          New York.
          GUNNER'S MATE - of the
          Ampbltrite.
          The latter died from the effects of tbc ex
          treme : beat.
          Of the Injured men three were on board
          the Iowa and four on board the New York.
          The names of those slightly Injured on the
          Iowa :
          Seaman Mitchell.
          Private Marine Mcrklo.
          Apprentice Hill.
          The- Injured on the New York :
          Seaman Samuel Feltman , seriously ,
          Seaman M. Murphy.
          Two other enlisted men sllgtly Injured.
          All the above named were injured by tha
          bursting of a shell on the New York.
          This is a complete list of tbe killed and
          wounded.
          The American ships were uninjured.
          The engagement began at 5:15 : , and ended
          at 8:15 : a. m. The enemy's batteries wera
          not silenced. Tbe town In tbc rear ot the for.
          tlflcations probably suffered.
          Tbc ships taking part in the action were
          the Iowa , Indiana , New York , Terror , Am-
          pbltrltc , Detroit , Montgomery , Wampatuck ,
          and Porter.
          The enemy's firing was heavy but wild ,
          and the Iowa and New York were probably
          the only ships hit. They went right up
          under the guns In column , delivering broad
          sides , and then returned. Tbe line passed
          thrice in front ot tbe forts , pouring tons of
          steel on shore.
          It is impossible to judge the amount ot
          damage done to the buildings and fort * .
          They appeared to bo riddled with shot , but
          the Spaniards were plucky.
          The after-turret of the Amphltrlte got out
          of order temporarily during the engagement ,
          but It banged away with its forward guns.
          After the flrst passage before the forts
          tbe Detroit and tbc Montgomery retired ,
          their guns .being too small to do much dam
          age. The Porter and Wampatuck also
          stayed out ot range.
          The smoke hung over everything , spoiling
          tbe aim of the gunners and making It Im
          possible to tell where our shots struck.
          The officers and men of all the ships be
          haved with coolness and bravery. The shots
          flew thick and fast over all our ships.
          Tbc men of the Iowa who were hurt dur
          ing the action were hurt by splinters thrown
          by an eight-Inch shell , which came through
          a boat Into the superstructure , and scat
          tered fragments In all dlretlons. The shot's
          course was finally ended on an iron plate
          an Inch thick.
          Merkle was struck on tbe arm and may
          lose It. All were hurt by splinters , and a
          fire was started in tbe boat , but wan quickly
          extinguished.
          Morro battery on tbo eastward arm of the
          harbor was tbe principal point of attack.
          Rear Admiral Sampson and Captain Evans
          v/pre on tbo lower bridge of tbe Iowa , and
          had a narrow escape from flying splinters ,
          which injured three men.
          The Iowa was bit eight times , but tbe
          shells made no impression on Its armor.
          The weather was fine , but the heavy
          swells made accurate aim difficult
          The broadsides from the Iowa and Indiana
          rumbled in the bills ashore for five minutes
          after they were delivered. Clouds of dust
          showed where the shells struck , but the
          smoke bung over everything.
          The shells screeching overhead and drop
          ping around showed that tbe Spaniard * still
          stuck to their guns.
          At 3 o'clock In tbe morning all l &lt; ands were
                                              called on tbe Iowa. A few final actions la
                                              clearing ship were taken and at 6 o'clock
          "general quarters" sounded. Tb xmen were1
          ragcr for the fight.
          The tug Wampatuck went ahead and
          anchored Us small boats to the westward ,

        <text>YELLOW JOURNALISM
        There is considerable being said
        just now about yellow journalism.
        To our notion journalism is not half
        yello.v enough. It seems that it will
        have to be so rotten yellow that it
        will splatter when it hits to make
        this administration get a move on
        and go to fighting. Outside of the
        Dewey engagement there has been
        very little to commend in the war
        with Spain. The Cubans, reeoncen
        trados, who Uncle Sam went to war
        to help, are dying off faster now than
        they were before war began, and
        there seems to be no t Ming when
        troops are to be sent . iielp them
        out by furnishing food a..:! ammuni
        tion, Sampson is cruising around
        the Caribbean Sea looking for the
        Spanish fleet, and troops are being
        shipped back and forth across the
        continent at gieat expense to the
        government and big piofit to the rail
        roads. California, Nevada and Ari
        zona boys are being carted clear
        across the hemisphere to Florida,
        while Eastern troops are being sent
        to the Pacific Coast to go to Manila.
        Forty or fifty thousand troops are
        congregated in Southern ports and
        are in danger of sickness, while if
        they had been shipped into Cuba two
        weeks ago thty would have all the
        Spaniards in the Island driven into
        Havana by this time. It would then
        be a clear case of surrender, with
        Sampson outside to blow the Span
        iards into eternity if they did not do
        so. Dewey may not be in immediate
        need of assistance, but he will need
        it soon if the Philippines are to b-
        held, and 40,000 men ought to be
        half-way there by this time. As it is
        no vessel with supplies even, has yet
        started. The yellow journals ought
        to fire a stockingful or two of yellow
        mud into the camp of the money
        manipulators f this country who aie
        to blame for this delay. Lyon

          Ing prediction from first to last that there
          would bo no rupture In the peace nego
          tiations was completely justified today
          when the Spanish commissioners signified
          their acceptance , though urler protest , of
          the American demands relating to the Phil
          ippines , Senor Abarzuza said to mo to
          night :
          "Wo bavo fulfilled our mission hero and
          agreed to make a treaty ot peace , but we
          J do so under protest that our sovereign
          rights over the Philippines are still Intact.
          Our memorandum today sets this fact forth ,
          though admittedly it cannot affect the
          treaty. Wo lose a colonial empire , but
          America does not know what new and diffi
          cult responsibilities she Is undertaking.
          Mindanao alone will keep her busy for
          years. "
          "Will the treaty contain any reference
          to the debts ? "
          "No , inasmuch ns the Americana have
          put these questions aside and refused to
          take them into account when framing a
          treaty. Subsidiary matters , such as the
          Carolines , a cable station and so on will
          also bo dealt with separately. I do not
          expect more than two or three sittings
          after Wednesday. "
          Ojeda , the principal Spanish secretary ,
          o id : "Peace is assured and we have
          agreed to sign a treaty In accordance with
          the protocol of Washington , but at the
          eamo time protesting our sovereign rights
          over the Philippines and stating that we
          only yield to the hard American terms
          owing to our Inability to renew the war
          nd In the presence of superior force. "
          Secretary Moore said : "The Spaniards
          accepted our conditions unreservedly. A
          draft of the treaty will be laid before the
          Joint meeting next Wednesday. They have
          accepted 120,000,000 for the Philippines.
          American * Are Relieved.
          The American commissioners are highly
          pleased and relieved that the crisis has
          been' successfully surmounted , as they did
          disguised gra'tlflcatlon : "I hope -we shall
          " "be sailing for home in a fortnight. Every
          thing Is now clear. "
          The Spanish commissioners were glcomy
          And depressed at today's meeting and there
          was no Interchange of the usual compli
          ments and civilities. They were perform
          ing an ungrateful task under compulsion ,
          tor it is known that Rlos asked Sagasta
          to accept the resignation of the commis
          sion rather than force It to accede to the
          surrender of Spain's colonial empire , but
          Sngasta appealed to them to fulfill their

          PARIS , Nov. 28. Spain has accepted the
          United States offer ot $20,000,000 and at a
          joint session of the peace commissions the
          Spanish commissioners consented wlthou
          condition to relinquish Cuba and to cede
          Porto Rico , Guan and the Philippine
          islands.
          The document presenting this acceptance
          contained only 300 words. It opened with
          a reference to the final terms of the United
          States and said the Spanish commissioners
          after having taken cognizance of the terms
          proposed by the Americans , replied tba
          their government had tried to give a
          equitable an answer as soon as possible
          but that they were not prepared to comml
          their government to the acceptance of the
          principles embodied In the American nrgu
          ment. Spain rejects these principles and In
          the note says "it has rejected them. "
          Basing Its attitude upon the justice of It
          cause , the note then says It still adheres to
          these principles , "which It has heretofore in
          variably formulated. "
          However , the note adds , in the desire to
          peace Spain has gone so far as to propos
          certain compromises , which the American
          have always rejected. It has also attempted
          it Is further asserted , to have submitted to
          arbitration some of the material particulars
          upon which the two governments differed
          These proposals for arbitration , It Is added
          the Americana had equally rejected.
          American * Heject All Spain Proposed
          These allegations , In Spain's reply , as t
          attempted arbitration , refer to its propcsa
          to arbitrate the construction of the thin
          article ot the protocol and also to tubml
          the Spanish colonial debt ot Cuba and th
          Philippines to arbitration. The last propo
          eltlon is submitted In a written communlca
          tlon. Since Its presentation and Its rctur
          ( or such arbitration Spain offered to cede th
          territory in dispute.
          The Americans refused both proposition
          for arbitration. Spain's reply today , I
          substance , continued by declaring that th
          United States has offered , as a kind of com
          prnsatlon to Spain , something very tnade
          quate to the- sacrifices the latter countr
          niakes at this moment and it feels , there
          fore , that the United States' proposal canno
          bo considered just and equitable.
          Spain baa , however , exhausted all the ro
          ources of diplomacy In an attempt to Justify
          er attitude.
          Seeing that an acceptance of the proposal
          nade to Spain Is a necessary condition to
          10 continuance of negotiations and seeing
          bat the resource * of Spain are not such
          s to enable It to re-enter war , It Is Im-
          died by a desire to prevent bloodshed to
          ubmlt to the conditions of the conquering
          latlon , however harsh they may bo. Spain
          s , therefore , ready to accept the proposal
          f the American commission as presented
          t the last sitting.
          The reading of the translation of the doc-
          ment occupied less than five minutes.
          At the conclusion of the translation the
          ommlssloners empowered Scnor Ojeda , sec-
          ctary of the Spanish commission , and Sec-
          ctary Moore of the American commission
          o draw up articles which are to embody
          fie rcllnqulshmciit of Cuba by Spain and
          he cession of Porto Rico and the Philip-
          Incs. Theao articles , which may bo con-

          Hard to Ilcllnqnlflh I.nut Hold.
          A great deal of Interest was taken In to-
          ay's meeting. The two commissions ar-
          rrlvcd at the foreign cilice In carriages , In
          bo rain , almost simultaneously , and , re-
          airing to the conference room , immedl-
          tcry opened the only business before them.
          enor Montcro Rlos , the president Of the
          panlsh commission , has usually preceded
          ho presentation of a Spanish document in
          writing by verbally summarizing It , but
          oday Scnor Rlos was silent and unusually
          rave. Hla face was deep-lined and he
          learly showed the mental strain under
          which he was laboring as ho approached
          he final rollnqulshment of Spain's colonial
          OSHCEElonS.
          Without a word Senor Montero Rlos pro-
          uccd two typewritten sheets and passed
          hem to the interpreter of the United States
          ommlsslon , Mr. Ferguson , who read them
          ubstantlally as cabled , the outline of the
          Spanish document being furnished later tea
          a correspondent of the Associated Press by
          Senor Ojeda.
          The commissioners left the foreign of-
          Ice Immediately after the secretaries had
          icon directed to prepare the articles of the
          peace treaty. There was scarcely any con
          versation between the American and Span-
          sh commissioners after the adjournment.
          Among the Americans only the moat grave
          onsldoratlon for the Spanish colleagues
          was apparent. The Spaniards seemed to be
          ellevcd at having arrived at the conclu-
          lon of a long controversy.
          AtitnB-onlHtlc Huropenn Sentiment.
          There is no denying that the whole
          European continent will bitterly resent
          American acquisition of the Philippines.
          This sentiment Is not confined to diplomats ,
          but especially here in Paris It is the opinion
          onstantly heard in the highest French
          society. It is known that a high official of
          he French foreign office said yesterday :
          'Tho appearance of the Americans In east
          ern waters Is a disturbing factor to the
          whole of Europe. Americans , as Is well
          known , lack skill In diplomatic matters and
          vlll surely bring constant trouble to all
          of us. "
          As to the general sentiment , William T.
          Stead , who has Just returned hero from a
          our of France , Belgium , Germany , Russia ,
          Austria and Italy , and who has seen the
          ilghcst politicians in each country and In
          ome cases their rulers , said to the cor
          respondent of the Associated Press : "The
          vast majority of Europeans are , of .course ,
          ntent upon their dally toll , trier neither
          enow nor care what occurs in the other
          icmlsphere. But Europeana who read the
          newspapers are able to form what may be
          called 'public opinion' in the old world.
          They are practically unanimous on the
          matter. Outside of England I have not
          met a single non-American who was not
          opposed to the expansion of America. Nor
          through my whole tour of Europe have I
          met a European who did not receive the
          irotestatlons of the genuine sincerity with
          which the Americans entered upon the war
          with more or less mock incredulity. "
          Mr. Stead reports that the bitterest
          lostlllty of all was found at the Vatican.
          WASHINGTON. Nov. 28. The officials
          of the State department without
          lesltatlon accepted as accurate the As
          sociated Press bulletin from Paris announc
          ing that the Spanish commissioners bsd ac
          cepted the American terms. Secretary Hay
          lias been confident from the beginning that
          such would bo the outcome , although at
          times In the negotiations there were signs
          of serious disagreements that might Lave
          led to a failure of the commission.
          Work Still In Pronpect.
          It is not understood from the news to
          far received that the commissioners have
          yet reached the point of signing a treaty.
          Much remains to be done In execution of the
          last instructions of the State department
          before the peace treaty Itself can bo com
          pleted and made ready for signature , The
          work may be hurried materially , however ,
          should the State department decide to per
          mit the treatment of the remaining ques
          tlons to be settled in separate conventions.
          The Instructions to the American commis
          sioners sent last week were to arrange for
          a renewal of the trade rteatlee with Spain ,
          for the acquisition of Halan , for obtaining
          concessions for cable connections In other
          quarters and for the procurement of religious
          toleration In the Carolines. These things
          are not likely to be easily disposed of , so it
          may be that the American commissioners
          will feel that they have complied with the
          spirit of their instructions If they succeed
          In Including In the peace treaty a provision
          binding the Spanish government to negotiate
          thereafter on those subjects on lines that
          may bo very broadly defined in the peace
          treaty. In this case two or three more
          sessions of the Peace commission should
          suffice to complete the work of that body ;
          otherwise if Is doubtful whether the work
          can be completed before Christmas.
          The exact text of the agreement reached
          In Paris up to this point Is not yet known
          to the State department , although , of course
          it has knowledge of the general terms of the
          agreement. Consequently It Is not possible
          at present to obtain here a copy for publica
          tion of this Important document. Moreover ,
          it Is suggested at the State department that
          It this customary rules relative to the publi
          cation of treaties be followed , this particular
          treaty must bo withheld from the press until
          the United States senate In Its discretion
          decides to make it public. There is no rule
          or law , however , on this point and the
          practice Is based entirely upon a rather old-
          fashioned conception of the degree of cour
          tesy which should bo exhibited towards the
          senate by the executive branch.
          Other Nation * May Meddle.
          A call at the State department today of
          the Gorman charge d'affaires , Count Von
          Sternberg , gave rise to a rumor that he had
          como to make representations to the de
          partment respecting certain rights clalmct
          by Germany in the Sulu Islands. Whethe
          this is true or not would not or could not be
          ascertained. The department however , ha
          not failed to take notice of certain tndlrec
          and suspicious attempts to alienate thf
          Sulu Islands from the rest of the Philippine
          and has been forehanded In this matter.
          It was recognized from the beginning , an

          PARIS , Nov. 28. The minister of w r ,
          it. do Freyclnct , In the Chamber of Depu
          tes today , refused to Intervene In the Pic-
          uart affair and the house approved the
          overnment's declaration regarding the
          eparatton of military and civil powers , by
          vote of 437 to 73.
          Uproarious scenes , following the exchange
          f much personal abuse between members ,
          treats , accusations and general haranguing
          marked the day's session. Constant rcfer-
          nccs to the events in the Dreyfus matter
          tlrred up feeling to a high pitch and pcr-
          onal combat was several times narrowly
          averted.
          Great crowds gathered , much interest
          icing taken in the announced Intention ot
          ome ot the deputies to interrogate the gov
          ernment on the Plcquart case.
          M. Paul Deschauct , republican , announced
          bat ho had received a request to interro
          gate the government regarding the Plcquart
          proceedings and the premier , M. Dupuy ,
          iroposcd an immediate discussion of the
          matter. A motion to adjourn was promptly
          oted down and the debate was then taken
          up.
          up.A
          A radical deputy , M. Bos , opened the dls-
          usslon. He said that while there has been
          ome honesty In the Dreyfus prosecution ,
          hero has been nothing but dishonesty In
          ho Plcquart affair. These remarks caused
          n uproar.
          Continuing , M. Bos detailed the history
          f the Plcquart "persecution , " recalling
          Colonel Picquart's exil &lt; to Tunis and asked
                                    ho minister of war , M. do Freyclnet , why
          10 had permitted a court-martial to be sum
          moned for December 12. The deputy also
          ccused General Zurlinden , the military
          governor of Paris , who , he said , had prom *
          aed a revision of the case , of having broken
          its word. This caused another uproar.
          M. Bos concluded by Insisting that the
          lovernment ought to postpone the 'trial of
          Mcquart until the decision of the court ot
          assation In the revision of the Dreyfus trial
          s made known. This brought forth lively
          applause from the majority of the deputies.
          M. Mlllerand , radical socialist , spoke in *
          imllar strain. He said it was an absolute
          necessity to postpone the Plcquart court-
          martial , in order to avoid the scandalous
          contradictions which otherwise were liable
          o arise between the verdicts of the court *
          martial and of the court of cassation.
          The president of the chamber at this etage
          f the proceedings was frequently obliged
          o Intervene in order to quiet the uproar
          m all sides.
          Other Guilty One * Shielded.
          M. Perncare , republican , made an Impas.
          loned speech In the course of which he said
          t was not necessary to confound the army
          with a few Imprudent men. While the mem-
          iers of the court-martial were above suspi
          cion , the prosecution of Plcquart eavored of
          reprisal ( Applause. ) Colonel Picquart's e-
          * furtheTas-
          sertcd , was beyond all precedent and there
          were guilty persons , he claimed , who were
          injoylng scandalous Immunity. ( Applause. )
          "There are other forgers besides Plcquart
          who ought to be prosecuted , " exclaimed the
          deputy. "These Injustices will end by ex
          asperating the nation. "
          M. Perncare , who was minister of public
          nstructlon in 1893-95 , created a sensation by
          adding : "Wo were attacked for the Dreyfus
          irosccutlon In 1894 , but I learned of the
          Dreyfus affair through the newspapers. "
          Tremendous applause and uproar followed
          his assertion. M. Barthou , who was minis
          ter of public works in 1S94 , here Interjected :
          'I am ready to endorse the words of M.
          Porncare , which are true. "
          This called forth more applause and ex
          clamations of "It Is absurd ! " "It is Incon
          ceivable ! " Thereupon M. Perncare added :
          "Tho only proof of Dreyfus' guilt In 1894
          consisted of the bordereau. No cabinet min
          ister , nor oven the president of the council
          of ministers , heard any mention ot the con
          fessions Dreyfus la alleged 'to ' have made to
          Captain Lebrun-Renault. " ( Applause. )
          M. Cavalgnac , former minister of war ,
          said : "General Mercler secured these confes
          sions. " General Mercler was minister of
          war at the time of the Dreyfus trial.
          M. Perncare continued : "Captain Lebrun-
          Renault , when 'he ' was examined by the presi
          dent ot the council , did not mention the
          Dreyfus confession. "
          This statement caused applause to break
          forth from all parts ot &lt; the house , during
          which M. Cavalgnac tried to speak , but was
          howled down , although one deputy shouted :
          Let us hear the hero of the forgery. "
          Perncare concluded : "Silence has weighed
          heavily upon me and I am now happy to
          nave had the opportunity &gt; to tell what I know
          of the case. " ( Renewed applause. )
          Cnvolicnno Create * SurprUe.
          M. Cavalgnac reasserted that Captain
          Lebrun-Jlenault's evidence was given to
          General Mercler. "His report exists , " he
          aald , amid uproar and cries of "date , date. "
          "But , " ho resumed , "perhaps Captain Le
          brim-Renault has since retracted his admls
          slons. "
          Shouts of surprise followed this sugges
          tion.
          tion.M.
          M. de Freyclnet said : "The government
          on assuming office found the proceedings
          pending. Wo have only one anxiety and
          that Is to ascertain the truth. We do not
          object to furnishing the court of cassation
          with all evidence available excepting the
          evidence Involving the national defense.
          Both the civil and military courts are
          equipped to deal with the respective cases ,
          and as all desire to arrive at the truth. It
          will be reached. The government asks the
          chamber to respect the Independence ot the
          law. "
          After an appeal from M. Miller for a
          postponement of the Plcquart court-martial
          M. Dupuy declared that the Dreyfus affair
          "must remain purely Judicial as the only
          means of reaching the truth which may Dot-
          be attained. "
          Referring to the statements of M. Pern-
          care , M. Dupuy asked why that deputy had
          waited so long "before astonishing th &lt; &gt;
          Chamber with his revelations. "
          Decline to I otpone Court-Mnrtlal.
          " \V decline to' order a postponement
          of the court-martial , " said the premier
          "To give auch an order , even If we hai
          the right , would be to strike a blow at
          the principle of separation of the puNl :
          powers. It Is not within the province of
          iirllament or the government to adjust
          he connection which may exist between
          the Dreyfus and Plcquart cases. Our In
          tervention would be calculated to hamper
          the work of the court of cassation. We
          vlll respect the decisions ot the law. We
          ire a government of law and refuse to br
          \ government of arbitrary measure. " ( Pro
          tinged cheers ) .
          The order of the day approving the state
          meats ot the government respecting U &gt;
          principle of the separation of the Judicial
          ind executive powers was then adopted by
          a vote of 437 to 73.
          In the lobbies of the Chamber M. Dupuy's
          poech was Interpreted ns an Invitation to
          ho court of cassation to ask for the pro-
          uctlon of the petit bleu and other docu
          ments In the Plcquart case , which the gov-
          rnment would Immediately produce , thus
          ndlrcctly leading to a postponement of the
          ourt-martlal which the government has re
          used to grant under duress. It was arso
          icld that the premier had admitted the
          Ight of the government to Intervene re
          garding General Zurllndcn's right , but had
          only refrained from fear that intervention
          would be misinterpreted.
          Victory for AntI-Dreyfu lte .
          The vote In the- Chamber enables the
          anti-Dreyfusltci to sing a song of victory ,
          since the Dreyfuslte demand was for the
          government to order the Plcquart court-
          martial postponed.
          Nevcrthelsss the whole debate served to
          advance the cause of Dreyfus. M. Dupuy's
          ipetch is admitted on all hands to bo a
          masterpiece of statesmanship. Ho did not
          deny that the government had power to In-
          erfore with General Zurlinden , but cx-
          ilalned that it would be better for the court
          ot cassation to do so. Ho said that a fort
          night ago the court ot cassation demanded
          ho documents concerning the Plcquart af
          fair. At that time , for legal reasons , only
          copies could be given. Now , however , If the
          originals were demanded by the court they
          would be placed at Its disposal.
          M. Ribot , who was back ot the demand for
          postponement , followed M , Dupuy , and al-
          .hough ho still contended that the govern
          ment ought not to allow Itself to be a passive
          nstrument In General Zurllnden's hands , he
          had , perforce , to bo content with M. Dupuy's
          assurances.
          M. Cavalgnac's speech before the Henry
          suicide was accepted and placarded through
          out the country as a proof of the guilt ot
          Dreyfus. Now ho Is received with the howls
          ot tha deputies when he attempts to Justify
          his attitude. The general belief Is that the
          court of cassation will now demand the Plc
          quart dossier , thus delaying the court-mar
          tial.
          Demonstration for' lcqnart.
          PARIS , Nov. 28. An Immense mass meot-

          NEW YORK , Nov. 23. A dispatch from
          Havana says : Ulanco's retirement and the
          resignation of the autonomist cabinet In
          crease the difficulties of the situation.
          Regret la felt that the United States docs
          not take Immediate jurisdiction. Blanco
          Is carrying out his original purpose not to
          participate In any formal surrender of
          authority to the American flag. Besides his
          personal feeling In this" matter , he avoids
          growing dlfllcultlcs with the troops. One
          million dollars Is promised toward their
          payment , but advances on this amount have
          not been received. The Madrid government ,
          however , Is showing how energetic It can bs
          In embarking troops. Transports now In
          the harbor and to arrive within a few days
          will take away 15,000 soldiers by December
          10. General Castellanos , who Is the suc
          cessor to Blanco for the short period that
          remains of Spanish sovereignty , boa been
          In command of the troops In Puerto Principe
          province.
          Many Insurgents have asked for and re
          ceived discharges without awaiting the re
          turn of the Garcia commission from Wash
          ington. The Insurgent commanders have
          completed a skeleton organization of rural
          police from the ranks of the Insurgents.
          While this scheme Is In line with the policy
          of the United States , formal approval has
          not yet been given It. Disquieting reports
          are received from some parts of Santa Clara
          that the Insurgents who have been a part
          of Gomez's forces are not willing to give up
          their arms when they disband. They are
          reported to bo hiding both arms and
          ammunition.
          Sugar planters In Santa Clara complain
          because the plans for the early withdrawal
          of the Spanish troops were changed. They
          may auffer a temporary Inconvenience , but
          as the United States takes control In
          January there will bo no Interference with
          the sugar crop.

          who is engaged In behalf of the American
          citizen , Prank Knaak , charged with lese ma-

          "I have arranged that the prisoner , who Is

          neighboring table turned on the kaiser and
          the return of the monarch from Jerusalem.
          Knaak used 'tho ' expression on which his ar
          rest followed. Ho stated that the Insulting
          expression was directed not against the
          kaiser , but against one of the clergy who
          accompanied him ; that the persons who
          heard him confused the glergyman and the
          kaiser , hence the misunderstanding. "
          The alleged insulting expression employed
          by Knaak was excised by 'the German press
          censor from this dispatch and has'not ret
          been published.

          that one of the chief objects of the mission
          of General Garcia and Messrs. Carpoto and

          grant or a loan of money sufficient to pay

          The Cubans , General Macco says , enter
          tain profound admiration and gratitude for
          the Americans , but nevertheless they will

          LETTERS GERVERA WROTE
          Afralnnt III * 1'nnltlvc Opinion * the
          Madrid Autliorltlen Initialed on
          to Certain Defeat.
          WASHINGTON. Nov. 28. The Navy de
          partment has published through the office
          of Naval Intelligence the views ot Admiral
          Cervera regarding the Spanish navy In the
          late war.
          Captain Clover , the chlot Intelligence
          officer , explains that this Is a reprint of a
          number of letters published In La Epoca of
          Madrid on the Gth of the present month.
          The letters nre dated from before the war
          up to May G. They were written by Cervcru
          In protest against Spain rushing Into war
          In the face of certain defeat , due to the
          naval strength of the United States and the
          unpreparedncss ot the Spanish navy. Cer
          vera writes :
          "I ask myself If it Is right for me to keep
          silent nnd thereby roako myself an accom
          plice In adventures which will surely cause
          the total ruin of Spain. And for what pur
          pose ? To defend an island which was ours ,
          but belongs to us no more , because oven if
          wo should not lose it by right In the war ,
          wo have lost it In fact , and with It all
          wealth and an enormous number of young
          men , victims ot the cllmato and bullets , In
          the defense of what Is now no more than a
          romantic Ideal. Furthermore , I believe that
          this opinion of mine should be known to
          the queen and by the whole council of min
          isters. I have deemed it my duty to express
          my opinions to the proper authorities clearly
          and without beating about the bush. Now
          let orders bo given to me ; I will carry them
          out with decision and energy ; I am ready
          for the worst. "
          Captain Clover says Spain had neglected
          the navy and Cervera shows It was Impru
          dent for It to attempt war with n superior
          naval power. Taking up some of the vessels
          In detail In a letter written In January , ho
          shows how the Vlzcaya carried defective
          guns , how the Carlos V was a failure be
          cause of lack of power , and how the Cata-
          lunl , began more than eight years before ,
          was still Incomplete. And then be predicted
          that a conflict would bo disastrous to Spain
          In a letter written in February the ad
          miral speaks of the Colon having no guns ;
          ot other vessels being defective ; of the ina
          bility of the fleet to coal at Cadiz ; of their
          being obliged lo go with halt rations , and
          finally , their having no charts ot the Amer
          lean seas.

          tftklnk things 841 they arc , the Spanish naval
          force , compared with that of the United
          States , Is in the proportion of one to three.
          In such conditions a campaign , ho writes ,
          would bo disastrous If not an offensive one ,
          and all that could be done In an offensive
          way would be to make some raids with a few
          fast vessels.
          The admiral points to the futility of at
          tempting to blockade the United States
          ports and asks how the Spanish navy would
          make repairs should they win a great vic
          tory without resources. He says :
          "It would bo foolish to deny that what
          wo may reasonably expect Is defeat , which
          may bo glorious , but nil the same &gt; defeat ,
          which would cause us to lese the Island In
          the worst possible manner. * Only
          In case wo could depend upon Borne power
          ful ally could we expect to win. "
          The admiral refers to &lt; the Spanish Paclflo
                                  force as not able to afford even a shadow
                                  of resistance to the American naval force ,
          Further on he speaks of the war as at last
          In sight and laments the incomplete state
          ot the Spanish vessels. But after all , h
          says "that he Is glad the end is coming and
          is prepared to do his duty. He la ( on record
          as protesting against the Idea of sending the
          llttlo torpedo boat flotilla to Cuba , polntlnu
          out that a naval defeat for Spain would
          precipitate the loss of Cuba. He speaks of
          the surprise and astonishment experienced
          by all of the officers of his squadron on re.
          celvlng orders from Spain to sail from Cape
          Verde for Cuba , Inasmuch as they had united
          In pointing out the condition of the ships.
          Says the admiral :
          "With an easy conscience I go to the
          sacrifice , but I cannot understand the de
          cision of the navy general officers against
          my opinions. "
          The last letter In the series Is one from
          Admiral VlllamU of Cervera's squadron ,
          addressed directly to Sagasta , pointing out
          that the sacrifice of the Spanish naval forces
          will be as certain i it will be useless and
          fruitless for the termination of the war.

          BOSTON' , Nov. 2S. It is known definitely
          tonight that more than seventy lives
          have been lost In the wrecks of tugs ,
          echooncrs and coal barges during the
          storm of Saturday night and Sunday
          morning nnd it the steamer Portland
          lias gone down , as now seems possible , the
          list of casualties will rlso to 140 , with over
          100 vessels of nil descriptions ashore , two
          score of them wrecks nnd an unknown
          number probably beneath the waves ol
          Massachusetts bay.
          There is scarcely a bay , harbor or Inlet
          from Penobscot to New London that hai
          not on Its shores the bones of some staunch
          craft , while along Massachusetts bay and
          especially Boston harbor the beaches art
          piled high with the wreckage of schooners
          nnd coal barges. The record Is still Incom
          plete , for that ocean graveyard Cape Cod
          Is still to be heard from ,
          The annoyance and Inconvenience of the
          railroad and street car embargo covering tha
          whole of southern New England sunk Into
          Insignificance before the story of destruction
          wrought by wind and wave , yet It will be
          many a day before the full Import ot th &lt;
                disaster Is known or even realized.
                The Islands of Boston harbor are without
                exception strewn with wrecks and wreckage.
                No less than twenty-nine vessels nro ashore
                at Gloucester , over twenty In the supposed
          safe harbor of Vineyard Haven parted their
          anchor chains yesterday and are high and

          The upper harborr-of Boston' , Plymouth , U
          Salem , Portsmouth , Portland and of.h /
          places , where vessels were supposed , to M
          comparatively safe , were the scenes of nil- '
          merous collisions between the ships and tha
          wharves.
          Among the tugs which started down the
          harbor as soon as daylight came was the
          police boat Guardian , which last night was
          caught In the thick weather off Deer Island ,
          while endeavoring to ascertain the meaning
          of distress signals flying from the light
          house. It made for the tiny beacon which
          marks the Inner harbor channel again this
          morning and with a tossing sen and strong
          Incoming tide , tried to answer signals.
          Finally , It was learned that the llghthouso
          had no fresh water , for the heavy seas had
          broken In the bulkheads and spoiled the
          water stored there. There were flvo men
          in the lighthouse. The two boats which
          usually hang from the davltts had been
          splintered by the force of the waves and
          the sea was dashing over the llghthouso
          with such force that there was llttlo hope
          of reaching there.
          IIIHT Steamer Blown Out of Water.
          Beyond Deer Island lies the big : Wilson
          liner , Ohio , and the steamer 0. A. White
          of Taunton , ashore on Spectacle Island. It
          Is a matter of surprise to harbor pilots how
          the Ohio reached Its present berth. It
          stands up without the semblance of a list ,
          on a bard gravel bottom , 'In water which
          at fioodtldo this morning hardly came to
          the level of the propeller shaft. It Is firmly
          aground. That it should be In such shal
          low water Is duo to the fact that the tide
          In which she went ashore was fourteen feet
          above the usual flood tide.
          Leaving Spectacle Island astern a sorry
          sight Is that presented by the three-
          masted schooner Calvin P. Baker , on Shag
          rocks , midway between Boston light nnd
          the Hrew filers , where the deep sea rolls
          In and halt buries the craft , which Is
          fast going to pieces. The mainmast has
          been whipped out and hangs dangling over
          the side , supported by the top hamper of
          the other masts.
          From this wreck the two mates -were
          taken off by Captain James and bis crew
          from across the bay at Hull. It was day
          break when the Baker was seen and tlio
          lifeboat was sent out on Its mission. Tha
          pull was a long one and finally when the
          wreck was reached three bodies were SPOT
          lashed aloft. Two of them wore secure !
          and life was found In them , but the other
          had been frozen stiff to the lashings. The
          survivors and the body were tnken to Hull.
          In the fury of the storm two big newly
          built barges of the Consolidated Coal com
          pany were dashed to bits almost In an In
          stant. On the shores stood scores of men
          who were ready to risk their lives for
          those who were on many of the vessels
          In the ofllng , driving to destruction.
          Tlirllllnir Kienpe * of Hnllom.
          Captain James of the llfcsavlng crew waa
          there with bis men and boat , but he said the
          wind blew so fiercely that not men enough
          could find room In the boat to row agalnut
          the wind. Out of the driven snow came the
          dim outlines of a barge , with the forms of
          five men discernible on the deckhouse.
          With a mighty crash as It came down on a
          receding wave barge No. 1 struck the shore
          only to crumble and then melt Into frag
          ments which the waves In another minute
          cast upon the shore. But In that Instant
          five men escaped Impending death , for
          as the barge split In twain the deckhouse
          slid off toward the shore Into the surf nnd
          at the same time men on shore with lines
          about them rushed Into the water and pulled
          out the sailors.
          A moment later barge No. 4 came ashore
          and was ground up by the waves. Noth
          ing was seen of Its crew. Soon after this
          other wreckage came ashore and this mornIng -

          THE New York Press, in its 1 . issue of beptember 23,. rciers in seaming,
          terms to the attempt of the Hearst newspapers to palliate their grave
          and flagrant offense in their Vicious attacks on the late President
          and their encouragement of anarchy. The editorial is as follows:
          THE ONE DEFENSE OF BOTH.
          Tbe murdered President is buried, and thei world of necessity turns from the past to the
          future, taking up again the concerns of life. . •" " • ' T" . -
          There are things that need to be said, and that can be said NOW. , . ,
          Prom coast to coast of the continent -this newspaper has been v attacked, ana is being
          attacked, with assassin-like ferocity. ' . . '
          We are getting the preposterous teaching that It is a crime In a newspaper to be human,
          and animated and entertaining. '• ." ; k • • • A ¦ '¦ „ .
          Because a villain or a madman ha* murdered a'Presldent of the Intted States we are to
          have no more pollilcal controversy. ' " ' J " ¦ /«,.__ i
          Is nil life hereafter to be lived in a graveyard by Americans and by American Journal
          ism lest when death comes to a public man the severe word, Ihe light* word and the funny
          jilcture may be produced in the death chamber?— New York '^Journal, September 22. . •
          So this is the apology. Is it— this the defense? \ You r- were "human,":''ani
          mated" and ••entertaining"' In your assaults on the late chief magistrate? - it
          was merely -political controversy," was it. that fined your columns in ¦¦ your
          presentation of and comment upon the 'policies of the .McKinley administra
          tion in peace and war? It is only "light" werds or ."severe" 'words -that you
          have spoken about social Institutions and prominent men generally? So you
          say, so you ezcote yourself.
          Then it was '-human" and "animated" to intimate by parallel the violent
          death of William McKinley within five years? It was "entertainine" to pre
          dict "an awful bloodv Quarrel" between him, "the Commander-in-Cnlef,
          who had surrendered the control of the army and navy to the trusts."
          and the "American peasant." to whom he had "tossed the answer 'the
          trusts can do no -wrrons' " with his "fat. white hand." You say it was.
          It was only a "lieht" or possibly a "severe" word— illustrated. by "funnv"
          pictures, which we have been requested repeatedly to reproduce, but which for
          decency's sake, we have declined— to name him as "an obedient lellvflsh." a
          "Doliticastro." cue "ready to surrender every particle of national honor
          and dismitv"P So you have written it down. ;
          it was your notion of "politiaal controversy" to call him "an abiect.
          weak, futile, incompetent poltroon," "bar one. the most despised and
          hated creature on the hemisphere, his name hooted, his nsrure burned
          in efflev." So you have said in plain print.-
          There are other "light" or "severe" words on which stress might be laid. Such
          is your advice to anarchists to leave things alone and come and blow up Amer
          ican bankprs. manufacturers and corporation presidents. Such is your exhorta
          tion, to society to treat a certain rich man "like a wild beast" — merely because
          he Is a rich man. Such is your complaint after a collision between police and
          rioters that "there have not been enough shot. No trust manager has ever had
          a scratch." But we shall confine- the relation to these "light" words you spoke of
          IVilliam McKinley. , . .
          They "human"? They "animated"? They "entertaining"? They the language
          of "political controversy"? When you" say so, Hearst, you flee for refuge within
          that illimitable comparison of the martyr, who said of your pupil, "Poor fellow, he
          did not know what he was doing." You palliate, in so grotesque a distortion of
          the plain meaning of words your morai monstrosity with mental deficiency. You
          proclaim that your counsel has advised you, too. that "your only defense is in
          eaiiity." As your accomplice would escape in the straltjacket of the lunatic so
          would you In the motley of the fool. - . ¦ .. .-
          The Nashville (Tenn!) American said editorially on September 24:
          FROBLEM OF YELLOW JOURNALISM.
          The Chancellor of Syracuse University, James R. Day, upon being questioned
          by the New York Journal for an expression upon PresidentMcKinley, sent the
          following: ... , ; ¦ :. . ¦' . : • :
          Samuel Hicks, General Manager New York
          Journal— Dear Sir: Will you please never send to
          this office any matter bearing the "imprint of the
          New York Journal ? I loathe the New York Journal
          as I do the unspeakable wretch who shot our great
          President. I believe your paper, more than any other
          agency in this country,' helped to make the conditions
          which encouraged such assassination. To have our
          institution commended by such a paper would be a
          [burning disgrace. ; JAMES R. DAY.
          But what difference does this make to the Journal? The leading preachers,
          lawyers, politicians and editors erf New York City continue to write for its'col
          umris. No New York paper can boast of such a stanT of special contributors. As
          long as eminent leaders of thought earn pin money writing for the Journal, how
          Is the "common herd" to know its other pages reeking with foul scandal, and
          sensational fakes should be shunned?
          When the Maine was destroyed the Journal telegraphed over the country
          asking prominent citizens to accopt a place on its committee to erect a national
          monument by popular subscription to' the men who went down with the Maine.
          Most of the prominent citizens. Governors, etc.. accepted. One of the invitations,
          however, was addressed to the Hon. Gnover Cleveland, and was answered In
          this manner:
          PRINCETON*. N. J., F«&gt;b. 58. 1898.— To W. ,R. Hearst. New York Journal, New Tork— I
          decline to allow my Borrow for those who died on the Maine to be perverted to an adver
          tising Bcheme for the New. York Journal. GRQVER CLEVELAND.
          Mr. Cleveland's 'was the dignified and sensible answer to a cheeky request,
          what business was Jt of a newspaper's to raise a monument to the Maine's vic
          tims?
          But it Is difficult to draw the line between honest and intelligent criticism of
          public officers and the ravings of the yellow Journals -which' hold them up with
          pencil and brush as enemies of mankind. r .
          ¦ The yellow journal evil is well summed up by a Minnesota Congressman,
          who says:
          The evil of yellow Journals consists' in their pandering to the worst tastes of the Ignorant
          and depraved. Intelligent readers are not affected by their utterances, or by the persistent
          reiteration of false charges against public men. But to the uneducated man, coming from
          a foreign country, and knowing little of American institutions, the vilest cartoons and the
          moet Impossible accusations are taken at their face value. This man knows that in Aus
          tria. Germany or Russia the Government would not allow such pictures to be printed or
          utich charge* to be repeated, and the fact that they are published here in every conceivable
          form is evjdence to his mind that they are true. He is not a wide reader, and some cheap
          and pestiferous sheet is probably the only thing he ever sees. He learns from it that the
          ruler* of the nation are men of the worst type; that they are personally responsible for pov
          erty and misery. He comes to hold them to account for whatever he may himself lack of
          the g-ood things of life. What wonder that he becomes a grumbler, and finally an anarchist?
          But we are told the people are responsible, that the yellow papers but give
          them what they want and that is what they should do. Ought ignorant and
          untutored minds be given what they want? Mentally they are children. Do we
          Clve children .what they cry for? ..If we did their appetites, would soon become
          weak, capricious when satisfied, and not contented with simple and wholesome
          food. . . -•¦¦.• '
          A minstrel show in town last week gave black-faced representations of Mr
          Bryan. Senator Depew. J. Plerpont Morgan and other well-known citizens Of
          course., the galleries roared at their antics, and any respect it may have had for
          any of these gentlemen vanished when they cake-walked across the stage. This is
          an invasion upon the personal liberty of these gentlemen. This Is a free country
          but it is the essence of tyranny for a man's personal .' appearance to be carica
          tured night after night by a traveling minstrel troupe, and he to have no re
          dress. '&lt; - - •
          , This Is not yellow journalism, but they are one "and- the same— too much lib
          erty with other people's rights. ....
          The Ledger, of Tacoma,' Wash., published the following in its editor
          ial columns on September 25: ;
          FACING -ITS ACCUSERS.
          Yellow Journalism Is on trial. Cornered, It faces Its accusers. There was no
          way of escape. The rat will turn and when it turns there Is venom in Its bite-
          It remains a rat. &gt; ' &gt; • -. • '
          When the Examiner was charged. with having- created the state of mind' that
          breeds the spirit of anarchy, with assumption of superior delicacy* it declined to
          reply. It said It would reply later. Its respect for Mr. McKinley and for the sor
          row of the country restrained it: ]The body of the man it had traduced Is in the
          tomb and now the Examiner feels, free to answer the indictment. The fact must
          f&gt;e remembered that the Examiner is one of three papers on equal plane -the
          others being the New York Journal and the Chicago "American. Probably' the
          same editorial appeared simultaneously m all and one estimate must embrace the
          trio. • • •-¦,•••-..
          The Ledger is among the papers that have charged the Examiner with being
          a wicked and unwise sheet, an" evil and unclean thing. This opinion was advanced
          In sincerity and there has been nothing to weaken it. In Its rejoinder, directed to
          the. American people, the Examiner says It has been attacked by the parasitic
          the unsuccessful, the portion of the press that lives on alms. Such weak assev
          eration as this will carry no weight. The process of analysis is hampered by tha
          mass of the address. In general terms It Is the claim to personal purity and loftv

        ly Denounced For Its Defense of the
        "Queen of Anarchy" Against the
        Philadelphia Authorities and Its At
        tack Upon the Police For Attempt
        ing to Prevent Her Spreading Her
        Damnable Doctrines.
        While the entire nation is bowed in
        sorrow over the death of the beloved
        McKinley, an outraged people are cry
        ing out in vehement denunciation of
        those at whose doors can properly be
        placed the responsibility for the das
        tardly attack upon the President.
        Czolgosz, the assassin, has con
        lessi d that he was prompted to the
        terrible deed through ihe teachings of
        Emma Goldman, the "Queen of An
        archy."
        Emma Goldman, through tho me
        dium of yellow journalism, has been
        enabled to spread her damnable doc
        trines, notwithstanding the interfer
        ence of the police authorities, and
        since she has been taken into custody
        and the secret service agents of the
        United States have been at work the
        ramifications of the Anarchistic move
        ment have been disclosed with start
        ling results.
        CZdLGOStf'S SHOT.
        It was not until Czolgosz's shots
        thrilled and shocked the entire Chris
        tian world that the people awakened to
        the frightful work of yellow journal
        ism.
        Right here, in prosperous, patriotic
        Pennsylvania, was given an exhibition
        of the extent to which a yellow journal
        would goto further personal or po
        litical ends.
        Since the assassination of President
        McKinley the eyes of the nation have
        been directed to the work of Wana
        maker s Philadelphia North American
        in championing the cause cf Emma
        Goldman, when the authorities of the
        Quaker City attempted to prevent her
        ironi addressing meetings in the city.
        While the Hearst yellow newspapers
        in New York, Chicago and San Fran
        cisco were hounding the President,
        ■with editorials, cartoons and carica
        tures, all inciting hostility to ail
        minii ti ation and inflaming the minds
        of the unemployed against the govern
        ment, the work of The North Ameri
        can. i:i the light of recent events, was
        quite as stand Uous and outrageous.
        GOLDMAN AND HER TCACIIIN'
        It was in April last when Emiaa
        Goldman arrived in Philadelphia to
        carry out her purpose to make public
        addresses. The police notified her
        that shi would not be allowed to
        preach her Anarchistic doctrines,
        wkcr upon The North American, with
        an evident purpose to make capital
        among the unemployed, for its politi
        cal interests, ileclari d that it was an
        outrage to interfere with the "right of
        free speech." and at once began a
        serins of attacks upon the city autho
        ties.
        THE NORTH AMERICAN S RECORD
        Commenting upon the action of the
        yellow journals, the Philadelphia In
        quirer, oi recent date, said:
        "We presume that the New York
        Journal and the Philadelphia organ
        of We.namakcrism, familiarly known
        as the Yellow Pest, would resent the
        implication that they have bei n in
        any way responsible for the crime.
        And yet they, by their attacks upon
        public men without cause, have been
        firing the brains of Anarchists and
        leading cra&lt; U brained persons to be
                     lieve thra the removal of public offi
                     cial is something to be commended:
        "The man who shot the President
confesses that he has been a pupil of
Emma Goldman, the infamous beast,
who was, not. many mouths ago, sup
pressed by the police force of Philadel
phia.
"She came to this city to spread her
        doctrines of assassination and disas
        ter. The mayor and the director of
        public safety served notice that she
        would not be allowed to speak. Im
        mediately yellow journalism took up
        her i atis"
"Arid what did the newspaper that is
        run by Wanamaker money say?
        "Here are some quotations:
        " 'Tlie silencing of Emma Goldman
        is an outrage.'
        '"Tl.e example of lawlessness being
        given by the police authorities is at

        : ponsibility would rest upon the stu
        pid despots of the City Hall. * • «
        The law should be brought to bear
        upon the lawless mayor and director
        of public safety.'
        "'Now she (Emma Goldman) be
        comes the representative of the Amer
        ican light to free speech.'
        " 'lt is to be wished that, somebody
        might show sufficient public spirit to
        contest in tho courts the power of the
        police department to say who shall or
        shall not have the right to address pub
        lie meetings.
        " 'There is no law in the United

        "But as long as yellow journalism
        Is permitted to denounce public offi
        i cials as thieves without reason for
        doing so," adds The Inquirer, "just so
        long will a dangerous class be bred,
        ready when the Drain is excited to
        the pitch of action, to murder as the
        present product of Goldman and yel

        : THE YELLOWS ARE CRAWLING.
        The Philadelphia Inquirer has cer
        tainly performed a gieat service by its j
        prompt, incisive and crushing indict
        ment of the New York Journal and the
        Wanamaker yellow rest. We .certainly
        note a remarkable "crawling" on the
        part of the journals in question and
        a hurried desire to get in out cf the
        wet. But, as The Inquirer so graphi
        callj pointed out. their fell work has
        been done, 'heir pea.-on has been cast

        had to bear the blunt of this gospel

        the public will mark Its disapproval
        of such publications. We do not forget

        tions and absurd pictures during the
        miners' strike last fall. — Wllkesbarre
        Times.
        NOW SORRY THAT THEY SPOKE.
        Yellow journalism and anarchy are
        not far apart. The awful crime com
        mitted In Buffalo last Friday was com
        mitted by a disciple of Emma Goldm&amp;u.
        Not long ago, it will be recalled, she
        attempted to speak in Philadelphia, but
        the mayor and the director of public
        safety prevented her from so doing.
        Immediately yellow journalism rushed
        to her rescue, and Wanamaker's North
        American gave utterance to the follow
        ing. among other printed remarks in
        criticism of the officials for her sup
        pression: "The silencing of Emma
        Goldman is an outrage." "The example
        of lawlessness being given by the police
        authorities is at once dangerous and
        disgraceful. Should force be met with
        force the moral responsibility would
        rest upon the stupid despots of the
        City Hall."
        The above is disgraceful reading; it
        should cause Americans to blush for
        hhame. Emma Goldman, in Cleveland,
        spoke the words which fired the brain
        of a young man to attempt the life of
        our President. Had the officials of
        Cleveland acted with equal decision
        and prudence with those of Philadel
        phia, the crime would not have been
        enacted. One result of the attempted
        assassination of the President will be
        to make yellow journalism more ab
        horrent than ever, and our lawmakers
        should not lose sight of this dangerous
        element in society when dealing with
        anarchy and its attendant evils. —Ve-
        nango Citizen-Press.
        CRIMINAL AS ANARCHISTS.
        Emma Goldman and her nefarious
        principles are responsible for Csol
        gosz's determination to kill President
        McKinley. They inflamed his mind
        and they formed his devP'ah ambition.
        Emma Goldman was hailed as the
        apostle of free speech by the Phila
        delphia North American. That a news
        paper which professes to stand for
        reform and right living and honest
        purposes should boldly defend one of
        the most dangerous anarchists In the
        country and should denounce those
        who prevented her from uttering her
        treasonable, un-American doctrines
        would be almost incomprehensible were
        it not already known that it has never
        had a mission save the vilification of
        the men it disliked for personal or
        political reasons and that its whole
        policy was dictated by the erratic in
        clinations cf a few disappointed and
        disgruntled office-seekers.— Clue Ridge
        Zephyr, Waynesboro, Pa.
        YELLOW PERIL AND A CURE.
        The Journal has had no hesitation
        in pointing out where the real respon
        sibility rests for the crime the
        President. The yellow and irresponsi
        ble press of the country, by their de
        grading and malicious attacks on pub
        lic officers and men in high places,
        have fostered discontent, have pro
        moted anarchy, and made possible Just
        such crimes.—Chicago Journal.
        THE YELLOW PRESS.
        Another instance is called to mind in
        Philadelphia where another yellow
        paper was champion of Emma Goldmau
        when the murderous she-wolt had ar
        ranged to deliver a harangue in that
        city. The police authorities interfered,
        and the paper referred to said: "The
        example of lawlessness being given by
        the police authorities is at once dan
        gerous and disgraceful. Should force
        be met by force, the moral responsi
        bility would rest upon the stupid des
        pots of the City Hall. The law should
        be brought to bear upon the lawless
        mayor and director of public safety."
        The yellow newspaper made the right
        of Emma Goldman to stand up before
        a crowd and incite to assassination
        greater than the right of the authori
        ties. constituted by the people, to pre
        serve public peace, order and human
        life. On the same occasion Emma
        Goldman complained that the constitu
        tion of the United States had heen
        violated because she could not lash
        some Czolgosz in the crowd into shoot
        ing the President as he stood extend
        ing his hand to his fellow citizens.
        Such is the interpretation of the na
        tional constitution by the fiend who
        is worse than Borgia, and the yellow
        papers that flock to her support.-- St.
        Louis Globe.

        stated emphatically that
        the attempt on his life was due to the attacks
        on his administration made by the yellow
        journals of New York, which class W. R.
        Hearst’s paper has always led. The New
        York Journal may be said to have founded
        the school of yellow journalism: so bad was
        the odor of this paper, it changed its name
        and became the New York American-, but its
        tactics remained the same. As to the cure of
        yellow journalism, the Louisville Courier-
        Journal has this to sav:
        “There will always be on sale newspapers as
        bad as the masses will buy. Ethical principles
        deter some newspapers from seeking circulation
        by indefensible tactics and degrading a calling to
        the level below that of the scavenger, who at
        least removes putridity, while the yellow journal
        serves it as a delicacy. And a barrel of gold plus
        an inexhaustible supply of gall can readily be
        transformed into a yeilow journal that will return
        dividends upon the investment.
        “The press ought, it may be said, to reform
        itself.”

          GREATEST OF CENTURY
          [Special Dispatch ta The Call]
          LONDON*. Sept. 2.— Sir Robert
          Ball,, former astronomer of the
          royal observatory, now profes
          sor of astronomy at Cambridge uni
          versity and one of the most distin
          guished British scientists, has writ
          ten the following statement for The
          Call on what the discovery of the
          north pole means:
          By SIR ROBER BALL
          Two questions being asked all
          over the ciyilied world today are:
          First; Why does any one want to^
          go *'to the north pole? Second:
          How does he know when he's
          there?.
          To answer the second question
          first, the mariner who finds his
          latitude in the northern hemi
          sphere to be 90 degrees knows he
          can be nowhere else than at the
          north pole.
          The astronomer will tell you
          that to any one standing at the
          north pole the sun rises and sets
          only once a year six months
          daylight, six months night, miti
          gated only by a little twilight at
          the beginning and end of a period
          of awful gloom, broken by occa-
          sional moonlight or aurora.
          The pole is truly a unique spot
          on the globe.- Cook, \u25a0 standing
          there, faced due south. Which
          ever way he looked he was more
          -than 20 miles nearer the center
          of the earth than if he stood at
          the. equator. His weight was
          greater than anywhere else i on
          the surface of the globe. A
          plumbline in his hand pointed ver
          tically upward to the pole of the
          heavens, around which all stars
          revolve. Half of the stars he
          could never see, the other half
          never, went below his, horizon and
          would have been visible through
          out the six months of night.
          The famous constellation Orion
          ever circled around and around
          his horizon. The pole star stood
          directly over his head.
          Amundsen. Credits Discovery
          LONDON, Sept. 3.— Doctor Cook**
          narrative of his thriving journey to
          the north- pole, while it has not re
          moved .the doubts raised as to his
          having- really accomplished the fact,
          has at- least set at rest the improbable
          suggestions advanced in some quar
          ters r 'yesterday that he had attained
          not the -north 'pole, but the magnetic
          Captain 'Roald Amundsen in an in
          terview at Christiania on this pont
          "Such a position is nonsense. Th«
          magnetic pole is situated on the Amer
          ican side and it is quite impossible
          that- Drl, Cook could have been driven
          sofar from his planned route. I know
          Dr. Cook to be absolutely discreet and
          reliable. 'It'will be necessary' to await
          his arrival at Copenhagen for the
          facts."
          London Papers Skeptical
          The. London newspapers are- not
          wholly convinced by the narrative, and
          persist that it will be necessary to
          "await more" details and reports. They
          are: unable to conceive how a task,
          rrhich. has beaten the ablest -polar ex
          plorers provided with everything: that
          money could purchase could have been
          achieved in such a seemingly offhand
          and .unpremeditated manner and with
          such ease and quickness. At the same

          The New York dispatch stating that
          Rudolph Francke has brought to her
          a diary from her husband at Etah
          which Mrs Cook had transcribed and
          which would go far towards proving
          her husbands claims to the discovery
          of tho pole was denied by the wife of
          Ue explorer Mrs Cook stated that
          Francke had merely brought Dr
          Cooks trunk from Etah and that she
          knew nothing of its contents
          Mrs Cook said that as yet she had
          made no arrangements for meeting
          her husband and was undecided as to

          gether with his equipment of modern
          Instruments and appliances insures to
          the scientific world a rich feast We
          dont doubt Dr Cook but we merely I
          say that Commander Pearys superior I
          outfit from every standpoint makes
          it impossible that he should be mis I I

          Commander Peary and Dr Cook I
          are known to ho strong rivals and
          their discoveries doubtless will lead I
          to a severe scientific quarrel In i

          English explorer said today
          The news within a week he con I
          tinued that two men have reached
          the polo Is an extraordinary coinci
          dence We all expected to hear of
          Commander Pearys arrival some time
          during tho month and we sincerely
          hopod that the result of his years of
          effort and struggle would bo crown
          i ed with success
          I Poarv undoubtedly got the polo
          between him and Dr Cook the polo
          I certainly has been ranched It is said
          I Peary reached the goal April 26 1009
          lIt will be Interesting to know tho date
          1110 left hit base to go to tho polar
          sea and his rate of travel If Pearys
          opaod coincides with Cooks this fact
          will go far In the eyes of the world
          I to clear up the question whether such
          J distances as claimed by Cook can be
          covered The ice conditions around
          I Pearys camp In 1SOS should approxl
          I rat fjnrwhat the conditions observ
          ed by Cook
          in extremely unlikely that the
          i it
          metal cylinder left at tho pole by Dr
          I Cook will be found by Poiri because
          t of the drifting ror the Ice If Pear took
          a more owtprly line there is a pos
          1 aiblllty of his coming across the
          e
          cylinder but such a find would bo ex
          traordinary for a fall of snow would
          be sufficient to hide all traces of this
          tube I
          Peary from what I know of him
          would be the first to give credit to any
          one who preceded him Peaty deserv
          ed his success ho has devoted his lifo
          to Arctic exploration and nobody has
          a wider knowledge of Arctic travel
          In conclusion Lieutenant Shackle
          ton said
          While Pearys success will stop at I
          tempts to reach the North Pole there
          is a lot of scientific work to be done in I
          the Arctic regions which It will bo
          I
          impossible to carry out on marches to
          the pole on account of the quickness
          of travel I
          The question of the ownership of
          the land of the North Pole Is to come
          up in tho house of commons I
          Sir George Parker has given notice
          of his Intention of asking Premier I
          Asquith whether this territory is not I
          considered as belonging to Canada
          and if Dr Cook has planted the Am
          erican flag there whether or not this

          Messages received from Peary and

          the mysterious goal of centuries and
          the retreat from there to civilization
          This story will first cpme direct into
          a New York newspaper office which
          contributed liberally to the Peary ex

          to the Associated Press This first
          bulletin from the famous explorer was t

          tions come reports of the excitement I
          it caused following so closely on the j

          er Pearys dispatch to tho Associated I
          Press was road to him Dr Cook lost I
          little time In sending to New York a I
          number of cablegrams in all of which
          he expressed his gratification that
          Peary had also reached the pole and I
          announced his belief that Pearys ob
          servations would amply verily his
          own claim that he had been to the
          furthermost point of the compass I
          Dr Cook was particularly joyous
          that with Commander Pearys suc
          cess which ho did not In the least
          doubt all the honor for the achieve I
          ment was now fully American In a I
          telegram to New York Dr Cook dc
          dareR that the science of exploration I
          will benefit Immeasurably through the j
          fact that Poary reached tho pole by a I
          route different from his thus covering i
          another large unknown space and with I
          the Cook observations clearing a mys I
          tery which has perplexed geographers j
          many centuries
          That the North Pole phould be found
          and its announcement chronicled at j
          about the same tma Is but one coinci i
          dence In a strange series of facts which
          has kept tho public of tho world ex II
          cited perhaps as never before for
          a week I
          Among these coincidences are men
          I tioned that tho pole was found by two
          Americans that for the first limb two
          I polar explorers attempted to reach
          the apex of the earth at the close of
          the winter season over the frozen
          I polar seas that their first announce
          I ments of their success were quite sim
          ilar that both mon had devoted their
          lives to exploration of polar areas
          I
          that they bad been connected with
          l scientific organizations and lastly and
          probable Immaterially the wives and

          I city there IB an inclination to believe
          that the exciting news of the last week
          has been tho culmination of a record
          breaking race between the two ex
          plorers from the dom of the world to
          tho first telegraph wires which might
          bring them fame and fortuna Cook
          found tho North Pole April 21 100S I
          and after a Journey of terrible hard
          ships he made his winter quarters
          Jut about a year ago near Etah from
          which place he bail started for the
          pole From preliminary reports it is
          believed that Peary reached Etah last
          fall and after remalnjijg In the winter
          lht northern shore of Grnntlnnd ho
          started on his dash fqr the pole last
          February
          According to one ofbis messages re
          ceived here yesterday Peary located
          the North Pole April 6 last almost
          a rear after Dr Cook surveyed It
          His retreat from the pole apparently
          was not hampered by tho difficulties
          which Dr Cook met because It is be
          lieved that when ho reached Etah dur
          ing the present summer ho was in
          formed that Dr Cook had already dis
          covered the North Pole that he had
          been in winter quarters near there
          and a few days previously he had I
          started for civilization with his great
          news By that time the Pear relief
          ship Jeannie had reached Etah and i
          Commander Pear on board the Roose
          velt which had wintered at Etah
          started south as far as ho could go In
          the hopo of submitting his claim of
          success to tho world before Dr Cook
          This is indicated by the fact that ho
          and his party put in at Indian Harbor
          Labrador where they were not ex I
          pected There is nq cablo or tele
          graph line from there but his mes
          sages were yesterday sent from
          there by wireless to Newfoundland
          While the messages from tho Peary
          party have been exceptionally brief
          so far it is believed by Herbert L
          Bridgman secretary of the Peary Arc
          tic club that after filing his news
          paper story at Chateau Bay Labrador
          Commander Peary and his party will
          proceed with all speed to this city
          where they should arrive within fie
          days I I
          Dr Cook has announced that he will
          sail for this country September 23 and
          it is possible that Instead of two sep
          arate welcoming demonstrations there
          will bo one grand celebration of their
          return
          The consensus of opinion now seems
          to be that both men reached the North
          Pole and that Dr Cook was there al
          most a year before Peary and that tho
          latter because of his superior equip
          ment was able to gel out of the frozen
          country in a years less time than it
          required Dr Cook
          It Is probable that their return to
          this country may be mado a feature
          of the Fulton H dson celebration
          which Is to be held the latter part of
          this month and the first of October
          Dr Cook has not forgotten John R
          Bradley the New York man who fin
          anced his successful adventure Mr
          Bradley has received i the following

          Mr BridtmanJ whgAwas perhaps
          more familiar with Perils plans than
          any one man said that after dividing
          his party Into three groups one to
          make geological observations another
          to take meteorological notations and
          a third to establish bases ot supplies
          he probably selected five or six of his
          best men with from 501o lOll of the
          best dogs and made the dash for the

          It was written before Commander
          Pearys announcement had been mado
          and deals chiefly with Cooks claim
          to having reached the polo on April
          21 1903 It says In part
          The announcement that the North
          Pole that lure of the century has ac I
          tually been reached comes so sud
          denly and from a quarter so unexpect I
          ed that intelligent judgment on the
          fact is difficult Naturally writing for I
          the public and forwarding this account
          by cable only the personal and popu 1
          lar phases would be presented and any I
          statement of scientific results or data
          would be deferred But Dr Cook
          would probably not demand that scien
          tific rank and weight should be given
          to his expedition It was simply a
          duel with naturoman stripped for the
          fight encumbered only with the bar
          est necessities determined to make a
          life and death struggle for one thing
          only tho goal But tho world will ask
          that science though not directly In
          terested and served shall verify the
          claim and shall attest the result

          Says He Took Possession of Region
          in President's Xainc.
          Washington, Sept. —To the President of
          the United States and to the Secretary of State.

          tions that may arise regarding the right of pos

          i Arctic region traversed by Peary, and to the
          Navy Department, under which he is an officer.
          Commander Robert K. Peary ha* communicated
          the results of his expedition, and the fact that
          he reached the North Pole and hoisted the
          Stars and Stripes on April C last.
          As soon as he came •within telegraph com
          munication Mr. Peary informed the President of
          ■what he had accomplished, and followed this up
          Tit.i dispatches sent yesterday from Battle
          Harbor, wher* his vessel is now coaling and re
          pairing, to Has Secretary of State and to the
          Secretary of the Navy In reporting to the

          cent for and In name of President United States
          America." and that a record and the United

          The commanders dispatch to the Navy De

          partment, extending his hearty congratulations
          «n Peary'a "successful attempt to reach the
          iCorth Pole." Mr. Winthrop voiced the senti
          ments of the naval officials when he said that
          the Navy Department naturally was much grat
          ified that Civil Engineer Peary, who is an officer
          In the civil engineer corps of the naval estab
          lishment, had succeeded, after many attempt^
          In reaching the pole. The commander Is note,
          on leave of absence from the navy, but is de
          railed to duty with Has Coast »nd Geodetic Sur
          vey, making "tidal observations on the coast of
          "Grant Land and Greenland." The Acting Sec
          retary said there was no d^ubt that Peary's
          seav# of absence ■would be extended until such
          HaM a? his report to the Coast and Geodetic
          Surrey was completed. i^J^S^j

          were created in the Navy Department when
          Peary's dippatch came this morning saying lj&lt;»
          Siad hoisted the navy ensign on the North Pole.
          Unlike a number of foreign countries, the Amer
          ican navy has no ensign, but th&lt;» flag that flies
          over the vessels cf the navy is the Fame that

          w Again to-day the officials of the Coast and
          Geodetic Survey indicated their willingness to
          arbitrate the dispute that has arisen on the
          rival contentions of Peary and Cook. Up to the
          present time, however. th»re has been no official
          request for such action.
          NO REPORT TO SURVEY REQUIRED.
          Commander Peary. while missioned to
          Snake certain observations for the Coast and
          Cieodetic Survey, is not required to submit a
          report It that hureau. He will undoubtedly
          submit the results of the soundings and observa
          tions of tidal action to the survey hut the eu
          jwrintendent of the survey l.an no power to
          require a full report. This win probably be
          made by peary to the Peary Arctic Club, which
          financed the expedition.
          As Dr. Cook has no official connection with
          «h# government as regards polar exploration,
          th* question of arbitration by the Coast and
          «J«odetic Survey rests entirely with the two ex
          plorers.
          iTh* member? si the National Geographic Be
          ciety watching with intense interest the
          progress of the stories of the Peary nd Cook
          expeditions to the North Pole. Both Commander
          Peary and Dr. Cook are members of the 6o
          elety. It has been suggested, though not by
          officials of the society. tliat arbitration of the
          matter of the claims of the two men might well
          be left to the National Geographic Society as
          well as to the Co;&lt;*t and Geodetic Survey, in
          •view of the Inclusion of both men In the so
          ciety 's membership and the generally repre
          sentative nature of ass who make up its rank
          and file. The society, howtver/has taken ac
          tion attesting its concurrence in the accepta
          bility of the arbitration proi^sed by the Coast

          REGRET PEARY ATTACK
          DR. COOK GAINS FRIEXDS.
          Interest in Commander's Story Over
          shadowed by Controversy.
          Interest In Commander Peary's detailed account
          of his progress to the North Pole was overshad
          owed again yesterday by the controversy us to
          whether Peary or Dr. Cook was the. first to reach
          the pole. The naval officer's reiteration of the
          Brooklyn physician's untrustworthlness, as ex
          pressed In his dispatch from Battle Harbor, dated
          on Friday, served only to stir up the debate.
          Commander Peary* statement said: "Dr. Cook
          has not b*«n at the pole en April 21. 190$. or at any
          other time. He has simply handed the public a
          gold brick." As a result of this those who, have
          consistently asserted their belief in Dr. cook were
          more vigorous In their support of him. Men In
          terested in polar exploration who have tried to
          remain neutral were inclined to think that Com
          mander Peary had made a grave mistake in hasten
          ing to denounce his rival without producing proof
          of his assertions at the same time.
          On the whole, the latest dispatch from Com
          mander Peary branding Dr. Cook's story as a fabri
          cation appeared to have turned public sentiment in
          favor of the doctor. Even Peary's friends T\ere
          chagrined that be had let his Indignation overcome
          his common sense, as one man put it. While they
          could account readily for the feeling which
          prompted him to send such a message, they felt
          that the general public would not be so likely to
          condone the apparently ungenerous attack on a
          rival.
          Members of the Arctic Club of America, who have
          been preparing to f»te Dr. Cook on his arrival in
          New York next week went right ahead with their
          arrangements. Dr. Ronwell O. Stebbine. chairman
          of the executive committee of the club, had a con
          ference with Mrs. Cook last evening, at which the
          date for the club's dinner for the explorer was set
          for Thursday evening. September 23. UTS. Cook
          promised to use all her Influence to pet her hus
          band tp accept the invitation for the dinner, which
          promises to be a far more elaborate affair than at
          first planned.
          Captain Bradley S Oshon. secretary of the club,
          continued to receive applications bath for the din
          ner and for tickets on the steamboat, which will
          be chartered to take Dr. Cook's friends down the
          bay to meet the Okar 11. Bo fast are the applica
          tions pouring in that Captain Osbon said the club
          easily could till three excursion steamers. Brook
          lyn neighbors of Dr. Cook have asked that two
          hundred tickets be reserved for them. The Brook
          lyn people want to take Dr. Cook off the liner at
          Quarantine and make a triumphal sea and land
          procession of It to his home In BusßWtek avenue.
          Captain Ofbon received many letters yesterday
          from persons In various parts of the United States
          expressing their belief In Dr. Cook. Sherburn M.
          Becker, the "Boy Mayor" of Milwaukee from 1904
          to IS*'S. wrote from Atlantic City as follows:
          I'm with Dr. Cook first, last and all the time.
          Cook is a hero and a gentleman. Peary, if he
          reached the pol« after Dr. Cook. Is no greater than
          any one else who might do the same tiling.
          Samuel S. Whitehouse, once a candidate for the
          Supreme Court bench in Kings County, wrote:
          1 believe Dr. Cook to be the real hero of the
          North Pole. Peary, from his dispatches, if they
          be true. Is acting like an us and making himself
          ridiculous before, the whole world.
          "While I believe Peary may have reached the
          Dole," Captain Ofbon said, "his dispatches simply
          confirm the opinion I formed from those he first
          sent attacking Dr. Cook— that Is, he is certainly
          fast approaching the height of Idiocy." J. Knowles
          Hare, another member of the club, paid: "Captain
          Osbon's statement expresses my sentiments."
          Dr. Stehbins. when asked what he thought of
          Peary's "gold brick" dispatch, said: "I don't think
          Peary has any more proof about cook's failure to
          reach the pole than he had at first. In fact, the
          chances for his making good his assertions are
          lewtenlng every day. and confidence in Dr. Cooks
          story is steadily Increasing."
          At the office of R L Bridgmsn, In Brooklyn. Hie
          following dlepatch from Indian Harbor was re
          ceived:
          The ftoosevelt will remain here three or four
          days coaling. Expect to reach Sydney about the

          received. You are the logical candidate tor the
          polar commission. PEAR*.
          From the last sentence it was supposed that
          Peary would recommend to the government that
          a commission be appointed to determine the terri
          torial (supervision over the pole.
          Mrs Frederick A. Cook. who has refused to
          make any statement for publication on her hus
          band's report that he reached the North Pole ahead
          of Commander Peary, consented last night, through
          a friend, to account for her silence.
          '•I believe In my husband," she said, "and there
          the matter ends for me. I do not belong in tills
          controversy, and I have feared that if I talked at
          all. no matter how guardedly. I should b» dragged
          into It willy-nilly. Then there would be denials
          and counter denUls. and I should never get clear.
          For this reason I have, paid and shall Bay nothing

          French scientists suspend
          their Judgment In the controversy «n the ground
          that neither Dr. Cook nor Commander Peary
          has yet produced scientific or legal evidence
          that lie reached the North Pole. The question
          If regarded here as subjudice. and it is felt that
          it would be unfair and altogether premature to
          express opinions which, in the absence of astro
          nomical records and facts, could only be guess
          ■work. No one. however, doubts the good faitli
          of both Cook and Peary, and as Louis Liard,
          vice-rector of the Academy of Paris and Mem
          ber of the Institute, point* out. both claimants
          should be credited until their evidence has been
          scrutinised by s^me impartial Jury of scientific
          men. who alon« are competent to pronounce
          judgment. If. Liard hopes that both Cook and
          Peary have been able to take photographs of the
          stars, which could readily be verified by astron
          omers, thereby furnishing conclusive proof of
          the exact point where the photographer stood at
          the precise moment of taking the photographs.
          Alfred Crolset, dean or" the faculty of letters
          of the University of Paris, also inclines to the
          belief that both explorers have reached the pole,
          and. like his colleagues, awaits anxiously accu
          rate, detailed evidence. He says that the un
          certain and contradictory figures and apparent
          flaws In the statement of both Cook and of P^ary
          and their vague assertions may he due to hasty
          Writing or to errors in telegraphic transmission,
          and will no doubt be made ciear under a final
          p crosn-«»xamtnation
          Maurice Loir, the French naval expert, at
          taches importance to the fact that even th«
          location of th*&gt; pole ag given by Cook may be
          two, three or even five miles distant from the
          Peary North Pole. The point calculated by the
          best sextants user! by naviatlng officers, such as
          the two explorers probably had with them, are
          Incapable of the absolute accuracy that can he
          obtained only by the delicate instruments of pre
          cision used in astronomical observatories.
          Pome of to-day's newspapers doubt whether
          either explorer reached the North Pole. The
          "Eclair." for instance, says that Commander
          Peary is as fully as obscure and sensational as
          is Dr. Cook, and lays stress on «he likelihood of
          the personal errors of a man taking observations
          under the difficult conditions of the
          Polar regions Consequently, the results can at
          the best be only approximate, so that, notwith
          standing the strict good faith of the two claim
          ants, it may eventually turn out that the quar
          rel may take Its place aloneside the problem of
          the Man in the Iron Mask, the Queen's neok
          lace affair or the alleged escape of the Dauphin.

          erated charges have somewhat disconcerted the
          newspapers, which now are much more Inclined to
          suspend final Judgment until proof is submitted
          Some of the papers treat the affair In a humorous
          vein, and ask whether It is not possible that both
          are Muffins. They point out especially that there
          is nothing in Peary's recital Inconsistent with the
          •tat«ment made by Cook, and that neither had a
          white man with him at the pole. In scientific cir
          cles intense regret la expressed that a great
          achievement should be marred by a quarrel.

          RIDICULE IX EXGLAXD.
          Laughter and Regret Over Squabble
          Between Explorers.
          [By French Cable to The Tribune.]
          London, Sept. 11.— The commonest English
          comment on polar polemics is that as soon as
          Americans do something really great they spoil
          it by getting into personal squabble and abus
          ing each other. There was hearty admiration
          for Dr. Cook and Commander Peary in turn
          when they reported the success of their hazard
          ous and difficult conquest of nature in the high
          est latitudes, but Englishmen are now laughing
          outright over the wrangle between the two ex
          plorers, precisely as they smiled over the naval
          feuds arising out of the victory off Santiago.
          Americans residing abroad, instead of receiv
          ing congratulations from foreigners over the
          heroic exploits of their countrymen, are sub
          jected to good natured chaff over the bad man
          ners of their heroes and -the vagaries of news
          paper partisanship in a matter requiring scien
          tific investigation and impartial judgment.
          Dispatches from America state that English
          opinion Is wholly on the side of Peary, and that
          Cook is generally condemned ax an impost
          This is sheer nonsense. Commander Peary is
          known here and liked by scientific men, while
          Dr. Cook can only be taken at his own word
          until his records are recovered and his proof?
          submitted to experts of high authority. There
          is. however, unmistakable sympathy for Dr.
          Cook, as the under dog. and this is coupled
          with regret that Peary, instead of reporting his
          own exploits, attacked his rival in a savage way
          and sought to prejudice the world against him.
          A wag remarks that while the pole has bet
          found without doubt by one American or an
          other, the first use of it lias been to hang up
          soiled linen on it in place of the flag. I. N. F.

          London, Sept. 11.— The Cook-Peary controversy
          nan for the moment practically been dropped from
          the editorial columns of the London newspapers.
          and the only comment appearing this afternoon is
          a paragraph In "The Pall Mall Gazette." which
          says:
          Commander Peary'a story bean the impress of
          reality, and in a way it contrasts vividly with the
          unconvincing narrative of his rival. After readina
          Peirys nan-Hive, one can only feel that if r&gt;r
          Cook is really telling the truth as honestly as Com
          mander Pei«ry.; hi* is singularly unfortunate in his
          manner of telling it.
          The claims and the counter claimr of the rival
          explorers, however, have prominence on the news

          Peary was received to-day at the Sydney Hotel

          when he will arrive in this city.
          As the hours before she will again greet her

          John Kehl. American Consul here, and his wife
          have been doing all in their power. To this end
          an informal reception was given by Mrs. Kehl
          to Mrs. Peary and her daughter. Marie, to-day at
          the Kehl home. No. 59 Park street.
          Arrangements have been made for Miss Prary,
          Herbert L Bridgman and Consul Kehl to go
          down the bay to meet the returning explorer on
          the cable ship Tynan, which has been placed at
          the disposal of the newspaper correspondents by
          William Fugsley. Minister of Public Works for
          the Dominion of Canada. It has been arranged
          that Miss •Peary shall be first to board the
          Roosevelt, and have a. moment with her father
          before he sees the correspondents and repre
          sentatives of the Peary Arctic Club.
          The tug Douglas Thomas, chartered by The
          Associated Press, left here last night with a
          party of correspondents on board for Battle
          Harbor. It will take about two days to make
          the trip.
          Mrs. Peary and her party, accompanied by the
          visiting newspaper men, went to the steel plant
          here this morning and this afternoon took an
          automobile drive about the city.
          Nothing additional was received here to-day
          concerning the movements of Commander Peary
          at Labrador, and if ie now accepted that lie will

          The demonstration will be the greatest of its
          kind ever witnessed here, Canadians as well as
          American visitors being enthusiasts- over

          The affair will settle itself.
          He has not been at the pole on April 21, 1908.
          or at any other time. He has simply handed the
          public a gold brick.
          These statements are made advisedly and I
          have proof of them. When he. makes a full
          statement of his journey over his signature to
          some geographical society or other reputable
          body, it' that statement contains the claim that
          he has reached the^ole. I shall be In a position

          at the same time the climax will be

          mander Peary today receded some
          what from his stand regarding Dr
          Cooks claims to the discovery of the
          pole j It was not until today when
          tho newspaper correspondents ar
          rived from Sydney that tho com
          mander got a connected report of
          Dr j Cooks story After listening to
          the latest reports he was willing to
          admit that a rival expedition might
          reach the pole without his knowl
          edge even though he were In the
          arctic at the time Ho said In re
          ply to questions on this point
          torI
          Dr Cooks party or any expedition
          to arrive at the north pole by any
          one of a hundred routes and for ono
          to find no trace of it If our paths lay
          far apart
          This does not mean however that
          Commander Peary concedes that Dr
          Cook reached the goal merely that
          It I would be feasible for a competitor
          to do so without his knowledge In
          case they traveled by widely separ
          ated trails
          To show that Peary reaffirms his 1
          claim to tho title of discoverer 110I I
          wont on
          I am holding my proofs to sub
          mit them to the international polar I
          convention and thus controvert Dr
          Cooks claimsI I

          when she came to New York this
          afternoon with her two children to
          await the arrival of her husband

          STATE DEPARTMENT IS NOT
          READY TO TAKE ITS STAND
          Assistant Secretary Huntington
          WIlson Refuses to Be Drawn Into
          CookPeary Controversy
          Washington Nov 4Refusing to be drawn into the CookFeaI
          North Pole controversy the state department today declined a request
          that it cable American Minister Egan at Copenhagen to request of the
          University of Copenhagen permission to examine the records of Dr Fred
          erick A Cook when they are submitted to that institution
          The request was mrde by a delea I
          tlan from the National Geographic so
          cIety whIch will appoint a committee
          to visit the foremost Danish scientific
          Institution to which Dr Cook is to sub
          mit his records The dslre to have the
          request go through the officIal chan
          nels was made at a conference between
          AssIstant Secretary of State Hunting

          the official organ or the society Gore
          and Colville all prominent members of
          the National Geographic society
          The department took the request un
          der advisement and later decided It
          could not accede to It It was felt such
          action would constitute officIal recog
          nItion of Commander Peary as against
          Dr Cook that any unusual action on
          Its partmight be interpreted as an In
          dorsement of the claim of ono or the
          other of the two explorers as to prior
          Ity or discovery The department bas
          notified Secretary Grosvenor of Its at
          titude
          Members of the committee which

        WAXES WARMER
        Peary Disputes Dr. Cook’s
        Discovery Saying That
        He Never Got Out of Sight
        of Land.
        COOK WORKING
        ON HIS REPORT
        Will JJring Esquimaux to
        Aid in Proving His
        Claims.
        Copenhagen, Denmark, Sept. 9.—
        Dr. Fre,j A. Cook la working o nhls
        report, of the discovery of the North
        I‘ £•• and scientific observations made
        in the polar regions. When the re
        port is made public lie says that Ills
        claims will be established and given
        authority by scientists.
        In view of the denial of Command
        er Peary that JJr. Cook ever reached
        the North Pole, the two Esquimaux
        with Dr. Cook on his explorations
        will be brought to civilization to aid
        him in proving his claims.
        It is learned that the lecture which
        ■Cook was to have made ln'fore the
        Belgian Geographical Society, at
        Brussels, has been conceiled as a re
        sult of the Cook-Peary dispute. The
        society is waiting for more proofs.
        When interview d today. Dr. Cook
        said that he would place all his data
        •before a jury composed of scientists
        and then await their verdict. He is
        calm and apparently secure In the
        belief that his claims will thus be
        tally established.
        The king and royalty today at
        tended the conferring of the degree
        of Doctor of Science upon Dr. Cook
        by the Royal Danish University.
